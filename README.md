# AI-Powered Video Summarizer & Quiz Generator

This project demonstrates an AI-driven pipeline that transforms long-form video content into concise summaries and interactive quizzes.

The goal is not just compression, but **surfacing signal from noise** — helping people understand and retain meaningful ideas from long videos.

---

## What It Does

1. Takes a long-form video transcript
2. Generates a concise, human-readable summary using Gemini
3. Automatically creates a multiple-choice quiz based on key ideas

This mimics how AI can assist with media understanding, education, and narrative extraction.

## Why This Matters

Long videos often contain valuable insights that are hard to revisit or retain.
This tool acts as a creative filter — helping surface what matters most and turning passive content into active understanding.
