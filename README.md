CUTLINE

A Narrative Liquidity Engine for Signal-First Vibe Broadcasting

What This Is

CUTLINE is an offline Python prototype designed to identify high-resonance narrative spikes inside long-form human conversation and convert them into Vibe Broadcasting-ready artifacts — without flattening truth or generating synthetic slop.

This tool does not optimize for volume.
It optimizes for signal dominance.

Research Summary: Mango Magic Protocol

Mango Magic operates on a fundamentally different axis than traditional content systems.

Instead of scaling output, it engineers Narrative Dominance through:

Intel & Access – sourcing authentic human moments

Studio Environment – preserving emotional truth

Signal Distillation – isolating moments of maximal resonance

Vibe Broadcasting – converting those moments into vertical cinema that arrests the scroll

The protocol rejects AI-generated noise and prioritizes provenance, scarcity, and emotional compression.

CUTLINE is built specifically for Phase 3 → Phase 4.

What CUTLINE Does

Given a public long-form transcript, CUTLINE:

Segments conversation into semantic time windows

Scores each segment using custom Mango-aligned metrics

Detects 3–7 Narrative Spikes with the highest Narrative Liquidity™

Outputs:

Why each spike works

Emotional and narrative tags

Vertical cut guidance

Platform-specific hooks (X / TikTok / Reels)

A synthetic-slop analysis explaining why the moment is irreplaceably human

Core Metrics (Why They Matter)

CUTLINE introduces Narrative Liquidity™, a composite score built from:

Resonance Density – emotional + insight compression

Quotability – memetic survivability

Narrative Turn – belief or tension shifts

Human Provenance – uncertainty, specificity, contradiction

Synthetic Slop Penalty – generic or AI-flavored language

These metrics intentionally favor moments that feel alive, risky, and unrepeatable.

Impact: Fighting Noise, Preserving Signal

Running CUTLINE on a public podcast surfaces moments that:

Would dominate vertical feeds due to emotional volatility

Resist AI imitation due to uncertainty and specificity

Preserve the speaker’s original narrative intent

This is not automation for scale.
It is distillation for dominance.

One Ambitious Next Step

Integrate CUTLINE into a human-in-the-loop Studio Environment where editors receive real-time Narrative Liquidity feedback while crafting Mini TV Shows — turning CUTLINE into a foundational layer of Mango Magic’s Vibe Broadcasting infrastructure.

## What It Does

1. Takes a long-form video transcript
2. Generates a concise, human-readable summary using Gemini
3. Automatically creates a multiple-choice quiz based on key ideas

This mimics how AI can assist with media understanding, education, and narrative extraction.

---

## Why This Matters

Long videos often contain valuable insights that are hard to revisit or retain.
This tool acts as a creative filter — helping surface what matters most and turning passive content into active understanding.
