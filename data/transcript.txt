Joe Rogan podcast. Check it out. The Joe Rogan Experience. Train by day. Joe Rogan podcast by
0:08
night. All day. Hey Bradley Cooper, what's happening
0:14
baby? You know what it's like when uh like a Twilight Zone episode or something where like you're watching the
0:20
This is an episode where like I'm watching the TV and all of a sudden you're inside and you're looking at me and I got the Yeah.
0:26
All a sudden I'm inside the show. It's crazy. It's weird for me, too. It's It's weird for me that it gets weird for
0:32
other people, too. Like, when I see people being weird about it, I'm like, it's okay. I feel comfortable, just so you know.
0:38
Oh, good. You look comfortable. Yeah. No, no, it's excitement. It's weird for me. Like, I was trying to explain this to someone. They'll they'll
0:44
like, do people have a hard time being comfortable on the show? I go, I kind of do, too. It's [ __ ] weird. Yeah.
0:49
It's weird that that many people are watching. Yes. And then you start thinking like, oh, don't [ __ ] it up. Don't say that.
0:55
Right. But if you think about it, the fact that you did this long form setup and that we
1:03
live in a culture where people t at least say that every it's all about short-term Yeah.
1:08
goes against it. The people are interested. Yeah. Well, the short-term
1:14
stuff does work, you know, like short attention span stuff is very popular even with me like but I have been
1:20
resisting it more and more lately. I'm like like a [ __ ] heroin addict. Like slowly weaning myself off the drug. And
1:28
the more I wean myself, the better I feel like physically better. My brain
1:33
works better. I feel more relaxed. I don't feel like this kind like Sugashan
1:39
Ali the UFC fighter. He said even when I'm just scrolling, even if he goes, even if it's not anything about me, he
1:44
goes there's just like a lowlevel anxiety that I get. I'm like, "Yeah, yeah." Because like, you know, you're
1:50
wasting your time chasing a fix that you're never going to get and you're just like getting these these short
1:57
drips of like, "Oh, look at that. Oh, look at that. Oh, scroll scroll scroll scroll." But that's not what people
2:03
really want. What people really want is something engaging, something you go, "Wow, that's like" Like a great
2:09
documentary like which are still super popular. like a great documentary. They're still, you know, like huge on
2:15
Netflix and huge on YouTube. So, and Oenheimer was like three hours long.
2:20
Make a billion dollars. So, people went Humans didn't change. It's just you can hijack their reward system by giving
2:27
them some short attention span nonsense and it just like tricks their slow drip dopamine into like continuing to watch
2:34
this stupid [ __ ] But that's not what they want. No. You know, it's not what I want, you know?
2:39
No. It's a difference between like Yeah. Just a little drip of something that has the illusion that I'm getting what I
2:45
want as opposed to what I actually need. Yes. Which is sort of a reminder that I exist.
2:51
Yes. Yes. And that I'm communicating with somebody and I can relate to it. Yes.
2:56
Which is a different thing. And I only know this because I've never been on social media, but sometimes there was one time I got on somehow got on TikTok
3:03
and it was all police footage. You know, like uh and I was just I remember laying on my couch. 40 minutes
3:10
went by and I was just doing this and there was like the first part of the video and then what happened and then like the second part part two and that
3:16
was the only time I experienced I thought I gotta stay away from this because I won't leave the house. It's bad. It's bad for you too because
3:23
it programs you to think that that is going on everywhere in the world. Like if you have eight billion people that
3:29
are interacting with people all over the world and you only take the worst
3:35
examples of that and broadcast it and then it becomes viral and millions and millions of people think it rewires your
3:41
way you think about human beings. But the and the other thing is about memory. Someone was talking about
3:47
Niagara Falls the other day and I thought I've been there, right? And then I'm like, have I been there
3:53
or did I see a video like or was or was that one of the things when I put the
3:58
Oculus on, right? Honestly, I can't remember, but I know what it feels like to be looking at it.
4:04
Oh, yeah. So, the it's it's it's it's changing the way memory works
4:10
100%. Yeah. I've um come I've hit a wall in my memory like a tangible wall because and
4:18
I think it's connected to like Dunar's number like Dunar's number is the amount of people that you can keep in your head
4:24
like because we evolved in these tribal scenarios we we evolved with like 150
4:30
people and so the way Dunar uh calculated it there's like very close
4:35
intimate close circle people which is a small amount and then immediately after
4:41
that there's a slightly larger amount and then it gets up to what was it like it gets up to like a thousand people 1500 people
4:47
1500 people that's the most amount of people you can keep in your head. So there's like five people that like your tightest of tight and then 15 like
4:53
slightly outside of that and it gets all the way up to about 1500 people recognizable people
5:00
but I would think I'd be able to that you could keep in your head. Yeah. But I'm way past 1500 people so
5:06
I'm [ __ ] Right. Like I am like there's people that I know really well and then I see
5:12
them and I'm like I don't remember his name. 1500 sounds and it it seems bad. Like I'm like why
5:17
can't I remember his [ __ ] name? I'm horrible. I'm horrible with names. But it's just because my hard drive
5:23
sucks. It's like I don't have enough room, right? It's like you know when you the old iPhones it was like you've run out of
5:28
you know Mac space. Like ah jeez I got to start deleting photos and videos. Do you get anxiety with that or do you
5:34
sort of breathe through and say well it's just the way it is? I kind of just deal with it. I mean, it is what it is.
5:40
But but my memory itself is like very good and also very bad at the same time.
5:46
Yeah, me too. I I have a serious problem remembering people's names. Well, you think about how many people like as I was saying it, I was like and
5:52
I've watched the show so many times. I was like, Jamie, right, that's Jamie. Like as you were saying, like who can I do I remember any of the guys I just
5:58
met? I can't tell you one. I just met them. Shook their hand, looked them in their eye. They say their names and it just goes in and out and some people get upset.
6:04
What's my name? I don't [ __ ] know. Oh, you don't remember me? You don't? You know, I'm like, "Wait, you don't
6:10
remember?" No. What's my name? And you're like, "Well, that's why in Hollywood people love to
6:15
say, "Good to see you." Instead of, "Nice to meet you." Like, "Bitch, you met me two years ago." Like,
6:21
I don't remember. Yeah. Leonard Bernstein had a great thing that he would always I loved you in the last thing you did.
6:29
That's funny. That's funny. Speaking of which, I watched your movie um Is This Thing On? And it's good. It's really
6:35
good, man. It's it's one of the best representations of someone attempting to do standup,
6:40
you know. It's like it's a really good film. And you know, but it's not really just about standup. It's it's about these
6:47
people with these it's about they're they're actual human beings. Like these are complicated real like not
6:55
caricaturish, not cartoonish people like like I get that these are real people, right? Good. complicated real people
7:03
that are trying to figure out their relationships in the context of this one guy Will Arnett is attempting to do
7:10
standup. Right. So it was great. I'm glad you say that. Like so you because you know I moved to New York in
7:17
um 97 and and then that was my introduction to
7:23
any comedy world other than with my dad. I used to watch Ronnie Dangerfield's you know uh New Year's Eve special. We used
7:30
to watch it every year, you know, and it was Elaine Booler and Sam Kenisonson and and Dice and, you know,
7:35
Ela Boozler. I forgot about her. I'm pretty sure she was on there. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And um and I was obsessed with Dice when
7:42
I was like in eighth grade. I memorized one of his records and I would do it in the train station with all my friends
7:47
cuz back then that's all you did, right? You would memorize stuff. Oh, yeah. Yeah. There was no video to look at, you know. You wouldn't all sit around. You
7:52
would just memorize and then, you know, regail your friends with your impersonation of them. And then um and
7:58
Richard Prior was my hero hero growing up. That was my idol. So I had this thing with standup comedy. Then I moved
8:04
to New York and I'm all of a sudden immersed with these clubs and and Upright Citizens Brigade had just
8:09
started and I did this movie What Hot American Summer and all there was all these people. I didn't didn't even know about the state. Remember that show on
8:14
MTV? There was this all this and so I just you know little by little
8:20
immersed myself into that world and I just became fascinated with the culture. And then Zack Elephanakis, who I met
8:25
like in 2001, way before Hangover, I used to go and watch him do stuff. And I
8:30
just love the culture. And when Will was telling me about this, I was like, "Oh, let's set it in New York and the seller
8:37
because I just love the the geography of the seller, too, that you go in the olive tree and you walk down into this place. It's this whole other world." And
8:44
um and it just felt like, yeah, I really want like can I can we pull this off where it's authentic, where you watching
8:50
it at home and you get a sense. So the fact that you're saying that, you know, you feel like it got it, you know,
8:55
within the striking distance makes me really happy. Yeah, it's striking distance. It's like the one of the only films or like
9:01
Punchline was an interesting film. The Tom Hanks Sally Fields comedy, but it
9:07
was [ __ ] Like you watch it like what? They have lockers. Like what the [ __ ] is this? Like And also the comedy wasn't good. It
9:14
wasn't real comedy. It was like it felt flat and fake and people were laughing at nothing. The Will stuff felt real. Yeah,
9:21
it felt real, you know, like the clubs felt with the like a guy trying to work out what it's like to be on stage and
9:27
open mic and then the fact you got Jordan Jensen in who I love. She's [ __ ] great. I texted her afterwards. I'm like,
9:33
isn't she great in the movie, she's great. Yeah, she I mean, the minute I started shooting her and I was like, "Oh, wait a
9:38
second." Yeah. Yeah. It was like And the first thing I shot with her was one of her uh
9:44
one of her sets and I was just up there with the camera and I came around in her profile and actually I felt like I was in the Stars. She looked a lot like Gaga
9:51
and Ally, like singing Shallow. Oh wow. I had like this weird moment. I was like, "Whoa." Um, and then she was just incredible.
9:57
And then then as it went on, she had a larger part of the movie and then that whole thing when they're talking about
10:02
the small penis and we go up to her and just her writing that down and she was just so fluid and I was like, "Oh yeah,
10:09
she's got it, man. She's got it." She's great. She's really great. She's a really unique person. Like a very
10:14
unusual per like even just talking to her on podcast. Grew up on a farm with two moms and Yeah. Yeah. Amazing. Yeah, she could do
10:20
anything. I know. And she's so fun. She's fun on stage, too. Like she's great like working the crowds. Oh, very smart.
10:27
Very smart. But like her character, like the way she interacts, I'm like, "Oh, that's so
10:32
realistic. Like we should [ __ ] like that." Yeah. Exa. Exactly. And then you go back to the like East Village or
10:38
Chinatown apartment, you know, they live in. It's all one room. Yeah. I believe it. Yeah. Me, too.
10:43
It was great. It's it's like, you know, you're never gonna really capture standup in a movie because it's like to
10:50
capture what it is, you would need like years. And also, you would need a movie dedicated to it. Exactly.
10:55
The movie's not dedicated to it. Do you know what I mean? It was just about can I can I make you feel like you're there?
11:00
W that you're with him on stage. Yes. That what that could be like. Yeah. You know, the the silence and then the
11:07
cameras boom, there's nowhere to go. How did you work out the standup scenes?
11:13
Did you have real audiences? And then just real audiences because um you you
11:18
have to hit the quota of extras with SAG and all that. But but we we try to do it as authentic as possible, which was
11:25
everybody that works at the seller, they're there in the movie, everybody who agreed to do it. So all the waiters
11:30
and everything, the staff, that's all people that work there. Um Liz, who's the manager, who plays the manager,
11:36
she's the manager of the seller. So all those people are real. But then the patrons we I can't remember what the
11:42
email was or what the the the the ask was but like people who like to go to standup comedy who go who go regularly
11:49
and then once they were there I never told them what was going to happen. I never directed them once. It was like whatever the they're laughing at that's
11:56
it. And I don't do many takes so you're getting an authentic reaction. Now it's hyped up because there's cameras there
12:02
and it's a movie but they're not told what to do. It feels like that. And so, and even in
12:07
the mix, like we never added anything. There was no added laugh, nothing. Oh, that's great. Yeah. Yeah. It's all because I was like,
12:12
it's just got to be real because I wanted Will to just, you know, I just don't want him to act, right? I just want him to And that's why, you know,
12:19
you Shane Gillis was kind enough. The first time everyone went up was here at the mothership. Shane gave him four minutes of his set
12:25
and he and I and Will and I flew to Austin and we're sitting in the green room and Shane was like an hour and a
12:31
half late and Tony was there and he was so nice. I'd never met Tony before and that's where I smelled the thing. You
12:37
know, I did the smell. [ __ ] me. That [ __ ] is no joke, dude.
12:43
Yeah. Um and and that was the first time Will ever went up and we he was just trying some of that material and went up
12:49
as Alex Novak cuz I was like, when do you have an opportunity as an actor to actually do the thing you're preparing
12:55
to do? Like you and like think about how much that would cost. Like you can go into a room where there's real people.
13:00
It's all and then every step that you're taking you're in a club. So he did that and then when we back went back to New
13:05
York he did it like three times a week, four or five times a night for like six weeks. Wow.
13:10
Just so he could understand what it's like. And some people didn't know who he was. You know, you get a lot of tourists come in to New York City and there were
13:16
nights where you knew that he when he said Alex Novak, they're like cool,
13:21
right? Not like you're not Alex Novak, right? You know, like okay, let's see what you got. And uh so that was really that was
13:28
really great. How did you Who wrote this film? uh he wrote it with this guy Mark Chapel. It
13:34
was uh it was a movie that was more about his uh based on this guy John Bishop who's a real comedian is a very
13:41
successful comedian in the UK and and he will met that guy on a barge somewhere
13:47
and and he was at talking about his story and he was like yeah I was in was doing something else my wife and I were
13:53
breaking up and I walked into a bar a pub one night I didn't want to pay the cover that really happened to this guy so he put his name down and they called
13:59
him and then he was like yeah I'm getting a divorce and got a couple chuckles but he just loved it. Never
14:05
done comedy, nothing before that. And he kept going back and he like was obsessed by it. And then like weeks later, his
14:12
wife, a strange wife, walked into a place he was doing an open mic at with her girlfriends and he was doing a set
14:17
about their relationship. So that actually happened. Wow. I know. And then they got back together and they're still together. And then now
14:23
he like he tours around the world like he's makes a living as a comedian. That's incredible. Yeah. So when he was telling me that I
14:30
was doing another movie and I remember I was like, "What are you working on?" cuz we've been friends for for like 25 years. And um and he was telling me that
14:37
and I was like I just imagine Will because I know him so well and he's so charismatic and funny and just has this
14:43
presence that that is kind of lacking. I don't feel like there's like a male archetype now that fits him. He's like
14:48
he's like Robert Mitchum. He reminds me like a young Robert Mitchum Willeret. And he was telling me that I'm like his
14:53
voice and like that face stand up con like I just couldn't get it out of my head Joe. And I was like hey man can can
14:59
I read it like how far along are you guys? And I read it and I was like I didn't quite because like you I had never seen a movie that I thought nailed
15:05
it and I love standup comedy so much. I was like and I have no desire to try to redo it. And also comedy is so massive
15:12
right now and and the specials are so great and cinematic right now that there's no reason to try to make a
15:18
fictional movie about something that we can watch as a documentary or a docu series or a show that is authentic. I
15:26
was like so but I still would really love to capture it cinematically. So, what if it's a foil and the movie's
15:32
about the two of them? Cuz that's interesting. Yes. And you suck.
15:37
Well, that was the one of the great scenes where Jordan was like, "You're bad." You're bad. You're really bad.
15:43
And it's much more about just what what standup comedy anything. And you talk about this on your show, doing anything
15:49
that puts you out of your comfort zone. Yeah. Anything that pushes you, you're going to you're going to improve as a human
15:55
being. That was really what that that whole thing is about. And I just love the culture and the world. And I thought
16:01
there's so much tangible stuff there for me to get excited about cinematically and story-wise. But really, it's like it
16:08
could have been anything. Yeah. just something that he had never done that had he puts himself out there and that
16:14
in doing it and doing it he just sort of gets more comfortable, you know, and then the mic comes off the stand and then he's leaning against the wall and
16:20
by the end of it and then the way it was structured, it allows him to do that
16:25
vampire set at the end of the movie where all he's doing is exercising what
16:30
he's feeling emotionally because he's comfortable in this setting. Yeah. Because the old him when he has
16:35
that fight with her in the attic, he just would have kept that all inside and he would have been canatonic at his
16:42
kids assembly where we meet him in the beginning of the movie because you just don't know what to do with all that. But if you have an
16:47
outlet, something expressive. Yes. You can you can you know exercise it in
16:52
a healthy way. Yeah. So that that's what that that's that really was the point of that whole part
16:58
of it being standup comedy and open mic. What you really nailed is someone trying it for the first time. You you guys
17:05
really nailed that. You really nailed a beginner in comedy. Like it seemed
17:10
completely realistic. Great. Yeah. And like I think that's one of the reasons why Kill Tony is so popular.
17:16
Yes. You know, cuz you get to see like you can't that that raw reality of someone
17:22
who has never done standup before. Like there was people that went up at Madison Square Garden in front of 16,000 people
17:27
that had never done standup before. Dude, dude. No, no, no. That's just Who knows?
17:34
Don't do that. You should be in a [ __ ] smoky room. Well, not smokey anymore, but a tiny
17:40
[ __ ] room where of disinterested people, where everyone's bombing and you bomb to it, it's not that big a deal cuz
17:46
you might have some potential, but if you [ __ ] bomb in front of 16,000 people, the pain of that, you may
17:52
never recover. Also, just think about the a like because you're going to hear your voice through the, you know, echoing. It's It
17:58
can't be just an like So there I imagine there's an echo. So you're not only bombing, but you're hearing it
18:04
reverberate. You don't really feel the echo. You don't hear the echo cuz you you have monitors on stage, so it's coming to you
18:10
pretty flat. Okay. But the noise of your voice where you've
18:15
never heard your voice into a microphone before, ever. And now you're in front of 16,000 people
18:20
doing it and then Tonyy's sitting there looking at you and Shane's there and I'm there. It's like a nightmare. It's like you're
18:25
you're walking into a nightmare. Well, but just doing standup in front of like a guy like Shane Gillis is crazy. He's
18:31
sitting right next to you. You've never done standup. You're going to do standup right next to a guy who's selling out arenas. Like, that's nuts. That feeling
18:38
is nuts. But it's wonderful to watch cuz you're watching authentic reactions happening in real time.
18:44
Yes. Okay. If your New Year's resolution was change everything and be a new person, good luck. So, instead of
18:50
pretending you're going to meal prep kale forever or do morning cold plunges,
18:55
here's one actually realistic thing. AG1. AG1 is a daily health drink that
19:01

19:06
gaps. Just one scoop in cold water each morning and you're off. It's got over 75
19:11
vitamins, minerals, probiotics, and whole food ingredients in there. So instead of guessing whether you need a
19:17
probiotic or a prebiotic or sorting through 10 different bottles of pills and powders, you can just do one scoop
19:22
and get on with your day. It's great because it feels like the grown-up move, but for once it's actually really easy.
19:28
It takes like 30 seconds and you'll notice the steadiness that sets you up for the day. Not wired, not crashing,
19:35
just functional human being energy. I've partnered with AG1 for years and if you

19:53

19:59
or visit the link in the description to get started. It's not processed. It's
20:04
it's as as clean a mental food as you're going to get. Yeah, it's true. Yeah.
20:10
It's just that we I think human beings really love seeing what it's like when
20:16
someone starts out doing something because a lot of people have these ideas like ah maybe I could try that or maybe
20:22
I could learn how to play guitar or maybe I could do that. But it's just the getting going and sucking at something
20:27
in the beginning is terrifying for people. So when they see someone just try it, I think they're like, "Oh, look
20:33
at him go. Look at him go. He's out there doing it. He's on the bike. He's moving." You know, it's like you see
20:39
actual people that are trying to do something that they've never done before. And it's exciting.
20:44
And also the the the one thing I wanted to touch on is the craft of it all. You know, that it's that it takes a lot of
20:49
work. I know that it's not, you know, just, you know, the writing, you know, when she says that one point she's like, "You gotta write,
20:55
you know, and keep going up." up and I think most people at least I didn't know before I started going that people go up
21:00
three or four times a night like I didn't and so that was something I thought it was important to convey
21:06
just the work ethic that's needed. Well, New York is really great for that and it's always had a culture of that.
21:12
It's had a culture of guys hopping from club to club and doing set to set because there's so many clubs in in
21:18
Manhattan. So guys would just, you know, uh I think the most guy I ever heard one
21:23
guy did eight eight or nine sets a night. Like they just like that's how many clubs there are. So you just hop all
21:28
over the place. You start your night at like 8:00 p.m. Yeah. Downtown there's a ton downtown then you can go up. Yeah.
21:34
You go all over the place. It's um we've got a lot of that here now because there's so many clubs in Austin
21:40
now. I mean we went there. What you built is incredible. Thank you. Culture, everything. You know, I showed
21:45
the movie to a stand-up who hadn't done standup in like 15 years, and he said, "The only thing that for sure you got
21:51
wrong is the culture." And I was like, "What do you mean?" He's like, "No, people aren't that nice." And I was like, "Actually, I think you're wrong."
21:57
I was like, "It's changed." I was like, "People are supportive now." It's in where you go. There's places
22:03
where it's not very supportive really. But at least like I used to go to the seller like in early 2000s. Didn't feel like it does now.
22:08
Right. Well, I think Ari Shafir changed that a lot. He brought like the culture of LA to New York
22:15
where you're like more supportive of each other. It was always like dog against dog because it really the way it
22:21
all started out was in the 1990s it was all about everyone was
22:27
auditioning for a sitcom and if you and I were if I showed up to audition for a
22:32
sitcom like oh [ __ ] Bradley's here he's going for the same part. [ __ ] that guy. You know it was cuz it was like that
22:37
could change your life if you got that sitcom. Now all of a sudden you're [ __ ] huge and I'm still like
22:42
struggling to pay my rent eating ramen and it could have been me, right? And so there's this like serious resentment
22:48
that happens in the 1990s because everybody like the the golden carrot at the end of the stick was the Tonight
22:54
Show or you know hosting a late if you could get your own late night show. Oh my god, he made it. He's a host of the
23:00
Tonight Show. That was like the thing that only one person could get. And then there was like the sitcom like if it
23:05
really worked out they'd make a sitcom around you and you'd get a development deal. So there was people would
23:11
psychologically backstab people. People would talk [ __ ] to people before they went on stage. They would try to hijack
23:17
their [ __ ] mind right before like really it was dark crazy. And then the internet came around. And
23:23
then the internet instead of people being your competitors, they became not just your friends and not just your
23:30
colleagues, but also an asset. Because if you're doing a podcast and you've got
23:35
uh your funny friends on, then your podcast is better, right? And then if you tell people about their podcast,
23:41
then their podcast is better. And then you go on their podcast and that's better. And everybody benefits from
23:47
everybody else doing well. So it beca it completely reversed the system. And then
23:52
it became much more about being supportive of each other. And then everybody kind of realized like, hey,
23:57
it's way more fun when we're all having fun, you know? And since the television
24:02
thing kind of died off, the sitcom thing kind of died off with reality shows. And
24:08
then it was really just more about getting clips up on the internet and about getting and then there was Netflix
24:14
specials. So it wasn't just everybody trying to get an HBO special. There was way more specials and then you could just upload specials to YouTube and it
24:20
became this way more collaborative, supportive environment. And then Ari Shafir took
24:26
that that we had kind of like established in LA and brought that to New York and a lot of those guys ran
24:31
with it. Yeah. I mean that's the way to go. People always say, you know, there's a lot of room at the top. Yeah. There's a lot
24:37
there's a lot of room in standup for sure. You know, and it's like and everybody has their own lane even within this big highway and and everybody wants to be
24:44
with other people. Who wants to be a lone wolf really for a long period? Yeah, there's a few. There's a few out
24:50
there, but they're all psychologically destroyed. They're just a mess. Yeah. Who doesn't want to have friends? It's
24:56
crazy. Yeah. I don't get it. But, you know, it's that aspect of the culture I felt like in the
25:02
movie you guys nailed, which is a realistic aspect, a realistic portrayal of what it's like
25:08
where a bunch of people just they were all busting each other's balls. Oh, yeah. Yeah. You could be supportive and still honest. That was the thing.
25:14
There's no lack of honesty or criticism. It's just it's not done with the hope that you your demi for your demise.
25:21
Yes. That's the difference. Yeah. I think the '9s like poisoned a lot of comedians. It poisoned them
25:28
because it gave you this idea that the whole thing was about a means to an end.
25:34
And that end was a sitcom and everybody thought you just had to get a sitcom. You got to get a sitcom and that was
25:39
what everybody was working towards. There's people that were developing their entire act based around a around a
25:44
persona that they could sell to the networks. Were you doing standup before uh your sitcom?
25:49
Yes. I see. Okay. Okay. So, is that how that happened? Did someone see you and then they were like, "Oh, you got to you got
25:55
to try this show." Yeah, I got I got ridiculously lucky. Like, you know, a lot of people say,
26:01
"Oh, I work really hard to get on a sitcom." Nope. No. I got lucky. I did the MTV. I never had any aspirations to
26:07
act at all. I did MTV half hour comedy hour. I got a development deal and all of a sudden I'm in living in LA and I'm
26:14
on a sitcom and it happened in a couple. Had a great sitcom. I was on a bad one first. I was on a bad
26:19
one called Hard Ball. It was a sitcom on Fox where I played a baseball player.
26:24
That show got cancelled and unfortunately I thought it was going to go because I was [ __ ] I was, you
26:29
know, 25 years old, 26 years old and I was like, "Oh, this is going to take
26:35
off. I should get an apartment." So, I had a lease on an apartment and I wanted Everybody, I'm sure people were telling you that it was going to take off, too.
26:40
Oh, yeah. Everybody believed it. Yeah. You're going to win an Emmy. Well, the guys who made it, uh, Jeff Martin and Kevin Curran, they worked on
26:46
The Simpsons. They worked on Married with Children. They were really good. Wow. But then the Fox people came in and just ruined it. Like the executives came in
26:53
and they brought in a bunch of hacks and just ruined the show. Did you have fun doing it? Oh yeah, I had a I had a kind of good
26:58
time, but I also missed comedy and I missed New York people and I wanted to
27:03
get out of there. I was like, I got to get back to New York. [ __ ] this place. As soon as it was over, but I was like, [ __ ] I got this lease. So I had a lease
27:10
for a year and then I got a development. How long were you in LA at that time? Oh, I was only in LA for like a few
27:16
months. Wow. Yeah. So, I moved out there to do the show, right? I I got a lease like almost immediately
27:23
and then I was out there for a few months. Show got cancelled and then um I got a development deal to
27:30
do something for NBC and they were going to do my own sitcom and but as we were
27:35
developing it, they said, "Hey, there's a show that we're doing. It's called News Radio. It's already been picked up.
27:40
We already did the pilot. Uh, but we fired one pe one person from the pilot and we want you to read for this and
27:47
that's how I got on news radio. That's how it happened. Like that was this only the second show I ever auditioned for ever.
27:53
Wow. So I had one show went on air and got cancelled. You had a very unique track. Dumb luck. That's nuts.
27:58
Stumbled into it 100%. I can't take any credit for it. Dumb luck. Amazing. Just my ability to keep it together in
28:05
auditions and not not crack with no acting experience at all. But it was just not it wasn't something that I
28:11
aspired to. So it it didn't have the kind of pressure that it probably had for a lot of people. It probably didn't have the same kind of
28:17
elation too, right? Like you pro I assume it was not something you really wanted. It was like it was fun, but you weren't like this is
28:23
uh this is like this feels right. No. What it felt like is oo I'm going to make get money. I'm going to get some
28:28
money. Yeah. Then something's wrong. Was like I was like this is good. I'm going to get money and I don't have to worry
28:34
about money. That's how I thought about it. And then when I was doing it I was like wow I'm so lucky. Like how did I stumble
28:39
on? I'm here with Phil Hartman. This is crazy. This is crazy, dude. Dave Foley and Steven Root, Laura
28:44
Tierney. Like this is nuts. Yeah, it was a crazy, right? No, it was Paul Sims.
28:49
Paul Sims, right? Yeah. Who had just left Larry Sanders show, right? So he left Larry. Yeah, it was crazy
28:56
luck. Just stupid dumb luck. That's right. Soren did that other show with Jeff Daniels, right? Yeah. It was
29:02
it was a lot of fun. Um, so but but back in those days like everybody was working
29:08
towards that and fortunately I already had that. So my thing was just like continue to work on standup and just
29:15
work on my standup and if this all goes away I'll just go back to being a comic and doing standup in LA.
29:21
Yes. Right. So and so that was new. That's Yeah. And that's where I encountered like the worst backstabbing I've ever
29:28
seen in my life. So you're coming from New York where you didn't feel that. You didn't feel it as much. Right. You know, you felt like a lot of [ __ ]
29:34
talking, but that was fun. You know, the guys would make fun of if you bombed, right? They were doing it to your face. Yeah. They were doing it to your face.
29:39
And it was a more like um it was just a more ball busting like silly environment in
29:46
New York. It wasn't No one thought they were going to get famous in New York. You know, they were all just doing sets.
29:54
But in LA, everybody had this idea to get a sitcom. And then in the 1990s, they started giving out development
30:00
deals. That was the big thing. You get like a $200,000 half a million dollar development deal and then all of a
30:07
sudden you have all this money and you're living and so everybody was working towards that. So it became
30:12
instead of like people working towards just being a standup, it became standup was a means to an end. And then all
30:18
these other people, they were in your way to get that goal. Jesus. And then your agent was telling you
30:24
that's what you had to do and every because they wanted that money too. So it was all like programming people to go after the sign. A completely different
30:30
culture in the standup community there. Exactly. But then that all went away. It all went away. Like this the idea of
30:37
working towards a sitcom is not it's like working towards a career in ham radio. Like [ __ ] went away.
30:44
Well, you say that Ari changed it. How did he do it? Cuz he brought the LA culture to New York. Ari moved from LA back to New York
30:53
and he I mean everybody that I talked to in New York is Ari's like, "You guys are doing it wrong." Like and people listen
30:58
to him. Yeah. Well, because he was established and he was a really good comic. And they were like, "Okay, I think he's right." Wow. And they would
31:04
come to they would come to LA, like a lot of guys like Andrew Schultz and a lot of these other guys, they would come to LA and they're like, "Bro,
31:09
everybody's so [ __ ] nice here." And they're all just having a great time. Like, why aren't we doing that? Why aren't we just having a great time? And
31:16
so, it shifted. It's just It was the culture of the internet. The internet changed
31:22
everything because there was no longer this one thing that a hundred guys were trying to audition for. Now it was
31:29
anybody could just put up something online and then you all your friends became assets. They all became like
31:36
valuable to you instead of competitors. That's cool. Yeah. Do you go up uh in these cities ever
31:42
now? I do if I'm in LA. I'll still do sets in LA. I haven't been in a while, but you know, most of the time I'm at my own
31:49
club, right? It makes it way also I have teenage kids and they're I I want to be home.
31:55
Did you do the seller? Yeah, I did the summer back in the day, but more I did I did The Stand. I did um Catch when it
32:02
was there. I did um uh I always did Dangerfields. Dangerfields was great
32:09
because it was like a hole in the wall. There was hardly anybody. Is that where he shot his special?
32:15
Yes. Wow. Yeah. It was big in the 80s and then something happened and by the time I got
32:20
there in the 90s, it was like [ __ ] dead. One time I went there and I had a spot at like um 8:30 and I don't
32:28
remember what time the show started, but there was a few people on before me and I got there and the people that were on before me were sitting at the bar. I go,
32:33
"What's going on?" Like, "There's no crowd." I'm like, "There's no crowd? There's nobody." And so then this couple
32:38
walked up and uh they bought tickets for the comedy show and and this guy Bobby who's the doorman like, "Step right up."
32:44
It was a Scottish guy. Come on in. I'll have you seated. He se he seats them down. There's no one there, just them.
32:50
They sit down. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Dangerfields. Your first act and we all did standup for two [ __ ]
32:58
people. Wow. Yeah. The whole night was two people and they had a great time. I'm sure
33:03
they But it was weird. It's like when you're doing standup for just two people, you're only looking at two people.
33:09
But you also realize how much of your act is [ __ ] How much of your act is like [ __ ] dance moves? It's just
33:16
nonsense. Like English on the Q ball. It's like you're doing a lot of silly things that like don't even and you
33:23
you're not connecting with real humans. And when there's two people there, it like cuts the fat out of all of your
33:29
[ __ ] and you recognize where the flaws in your writing are and the flaws in your delivery.
33:35
But Dangerfields was it was a wild little place. It was it was like a classic comedy club that
33:44
didn't have any no industry went there. No agents, no managers went there.
33:50
Always. Yeah. It was just like a bunch of weird degenerates and it was fun. Wow.
33:55
That was a fun place. So, I did that club a lot. But a lot of I did the road a lot.
34:00
Yeah. Because that was how I could make money and I could headline. Like I do an hour cuz if you're in the city, you're doing
34:06
15 minute sets or 10-minute sets. That's great, but it's hard to piece together an hour at a 10-minute sets
34:12
because you kind of want to let the material breathe and put it all together, compose it into one big thing.
34:18
And you really can work on that a lot more if you're actually headlining. Do you watch a lot of specials, comedy
34:24
specials nowadays? I don't. I watch a lot of comics like when I see them at the club, right? But not not like um
34:30
No, I probably should. I probably should watch more of them. But really, comedy
34:35
is it's like an artistic form of hypnosis. And the real way to see comedy
34:42
is to be there live because you're like and you know when the person's locked in and you know when they're not. You feel
34:47
it. They got you. Like they're thinking for you. Like if I'm watching a tell
34:52
and he's at like the mother ship and he's killing. Like we're all like this. We're like locked into his brain and
34:58
we're letting him like take us on a ride. It's like a kind of a form of hypnosis.
35:03
And I I really think that a standup special, as good as they are, you're maybe getting 60 to 70% of the
35:10
experience of actually being there. That's why I enjoy watching them to see how different people make them
35:15
because there's all different types. Yeah. You know, some are heavily edited, which always brings me out if there's a way to
35:20
keep it so you feel like you're in the room, right? You know, I remember was it Mr. Tambourine Man or the T the Chris Rock
35:26
special where when he changed the tone of it and he started talking about jerking off to porn and how he became
35:31
addicted to porn and it was that great uh filmmaker who uh who's a comedian who
35:37
does music. He did that thing during co when he was uh um in his house
35:42
Bo Burnham. Bo Burnham I think he directed it and the camera just keeps going on keeps going on. by the time you don't even
35:48
realize it cuz you're hypnotized. You're right here on Chris Rock. And I think probably subconsciously just thinking
35:54
about it now, that's probably one of the things cuz that's kind of the frame I use the whole time on Alex on Will.
36:00
But I remember watching that going like when the [ __ ] did this become a close-up, you know, but that's what that's what it was
36:06
happening. So there was there was a synergy between the camera and what he was doing in the place or at least made
36:11
me feel like cinematically I was there and this is what he was doing hypnotizing me.
36:16
Right. And then the opposite of that was the special that Chris Rock did where he changed clothes.
36:22
So he was doing a special where he filmed part of it in one place and another part of it in another place and
36:28
he spliced the two of them together with different outfits. So you would have him begin a bit with
36:34
one outfit on and then end a bit with a different outfit on and you're like what a whose idea was this?
36:40
Yeah. Because the minute you cut and edit in any way, you know, even podcast audio-wise, that's the thing I've
36:46
learned. You know, some people, you know, they edit the audio of a podcast and you're like, that's not someone didn't take a breath before they
36:51
answered. Oh, like cutting out in between. Yeah. It's it's a whole other rhythm, right? Well, that's the YouTube thing,
36:57
right? They YouTube for a long time was doing these things where they would cut out all the pauses in between people
37:04
talking thing and it became like a style of editing where it's like shocking. for my years like I it's impossible for me
37:12
to get in. It's it's just impossible. Well, it's it's the short attention span concept, right? You're you're just
37:18
saying people are so [ __ ] stupid. You can't give many breaks. You you can't give many breath. You got to keep talking. Keep talking. Keep talking. And then you and it's like it's
37:25
after a while it's just like this wash and Yeah. They're just trying to keep you engaged as much as possible by editing instead
37:32
of by having actually interesting content. Compelling content. Yeah. Yeah. But it's an interesting exercise. Yeah,
37:38
it's it's it's it's I I enjoy watch like I think Josh Safy did Sandler's one and
37:44
he and and he did all this backstage and he walked up and then he was in many locations, but he was playing music a
37:49
lot. Yeah. I just like watching everybody's different, you know, sort of exploration of different standup shows because it's such a huge viable market.
37:57
So people, you know, it's it's fun to watch how they do it. I think that's probably why because I watched so many of them, I wanted to do it in a way in a
38:03
movie. Have you done stand up at all? Never. Never did. No. Have you thought about it when you
38:08
were doing the film? Did you think about doing it? No. No. Yeah. And I don't know why, Joe. Yeah.
38:15
But no, I just It's not like one of those things that I feel um compelled to
38:21
do. Would it would it be fun? Would I be scared? All those things. Um will I try an open mic one night? Yeah, I probably
38:27
should. Um but it's not I didn't feel compelled to do it. No. The problem would be if you did it and it went okay,
38:35
but you're like, I think I could do better and then um and then you're gone.
38:40
You know me. I know everybody. It's kind of the same thing with all of us. Yeah, of course, dude.
38:46
There's always a party like I think I can do better. And then next thing you know, like I got to leave. I got to go do a set. Like what the [ __ ] are you
38:52
doing? Dad, I haven't eaten dinner. No, no, no. It's like all artistic pursuits, they
38:59
can become an obsession and they become an addiction and they become a part of you and then it's like your brain
39:05
naturally goes towards that pathway of thinking about that thing all day. Yeah. Which I love.
39:12
Oh, it's great if it's a fun thing. I remember being 11 and watching The Elephant Man and knowing at that moment.
39:18
You okay? Yeah. I'm sweating. Yeah. Just got to take this. Knowing at that moment that like, oh, this is what I want to do for the rest
39:23
of my life. when you saw The Elephant Man. Really? Yeah, I remember. Why was it that movie? I I mean, I don't know. I mean, I've
39:30
thought about it a lot obviously. Um, first was David Lynch directed it. I remember the scene Anthony Hopkins. I
39:37
loved film. So, I always loved film. My dad loved film, but it wasn't like a conscious thing where I was like, "This
39:43
is it." And I remember, you know, in my living room, it's on the TV. I saw all the movies on the TV. You know, I never
39:49
saw Apocalypse Now in a movie theater or Godfather or anything. willing the longest runner, you know, none none none
39:55
of it. It was all on the television and um but I was watching The Elephant Man. It was on HBO. It came through
40:01
Philadelphia where I live, Comcast, and they would show like it all the time. And it was Anthony Hopkins coming in and
40:07
he's seeing Joseph Merrick, the Elephant Man, for the first time. And the way David Lynch shot it, you only see his
40:12
shadow. And then Hopkins starts crying. And I don't know, I was just like, I was there in that cellar with him. And I was
40:20
like I forgot it was in the living room and then the whole movie was like that and I it came out I was like I just want
40:26
I want that. So was that like the first seed that was planted? Yeah, that was it. It was the first and
40:31
only it was I was 11. It was like it was like bam. It was like a shot.
40:37
This is a scene right here. So this right it's right. It's this is it.
40:42
Oh, look how young Anthony Hopkins looks.
40:48
Yeah, he was a crow. Stand up. Stand up.
40:58
Turn around. Turn around. Turn around.
41:07
[Music]
41:23
[Music]
41:29
Wow. Wow. That was it.
41:35
Yeah. Wow. What is it like watching that now? Like
41:41
Yeah. Thinking that that planted a seed that changed your whole life. I'm like, well, first I thought, wasn't it a shadow? But
41:47
that was before. And then I'm like, oh, yeah. And then Yeah. Then I was just in it. Then all of a sudden I was there. Then I was like, is Joe in it? Does he
41:52
know what I'm talking about? And then all and then as my brain started going, the movie kept bringing me in it.
41:57
Yeah. And then then by the end, by that push in, I was like, I'm just watching this guy look at this thing for the first time. And then [ __ ] look at this beast,
42:03
Anthony Hopkins. I wonder what he was looking at when he was crying. I know. You know, because pull that out of your
42:09
eyeballs. Oh, dude. And I wrote So I went to grad school and moved to New York. wrote him a letter because our dean said somehow
42:15
he knew him or he I the the school I went to that I only got into because they let anybody in.
42:23
Um they did that show inside the actor studio. Do you remember that on TV on Broadway? Do you remember that? And so our thesis
42:30
was the show. There was like our our not like our there was a class that but it was a class like technically a class
42:38
and so all these incredible people would come on and Anthony Hopkins was there and and I was there for that and then I
42:44
wrote him a letter just telling him and I asked uh James Lipton that was his name the dean. Yeah.
42:49
And uh and then then you know and then never you know I never heard from him ever and then um you know and now I know
42:55
him dude. Do you know what I'm saying? weird, bro. It's crazy. It's so weird, right?
43:02
I never get over that. Me neither. Meeting ever. Ever. And there's some guys I don't know if
43:08
you feel this way too, but like there's some guys like then they become your friends, but still I still feel a little
43:14
bit of like extra energy when I'm around them. Like it'll never go away, right? Yeah, for sure.
43:20
It's crazy. For me, one of the big ones was Tarantino. Like hanging out with Tarantino. It's so odd going to dinner
43:27
with him. Hanging out with him here. Him coming to the club, he come hang out hang out in the green room.
43:32
That's nuts. It's just weird. It's like that's Quinton Tarantino. Yeah, that's Yeah. And it never goes
43:37
away. As close as you get and as even when your brains off, right? Cuz that's always the lipness. Is my brain off when I'm with the person, right?
43:43
That's like when like Okay. Right. And even like Clint Eastwood who I did American Sniper with.
43:49
I mean, it was always Clint Eastwood. I got to a point where my brain was off, you know, but still I'm just like, what?
43:55
If my dad was alive? If my dad was alive, he would flip the [ __ ] out.
44:01
What was it like doing that scene with the fake baby? Was that weird? It's so funny. I was just talking about that two days ago, dude. And you know,
44:08
I've come full circle. I actually think it's dope. Really?
44:13
I think it's [ __ ] dope because it's so just like, wow, look at these people
44:18
fully invested and it's a doll. like a scene where you're like kind of
44:24
like moving the hand a little bit with your I can tell you I could tell you the whole thing, dude. So, we had three sets
44:29
of uh twins and uh Clinton likes to shoot fast, which I love and love. And they were
44:36
crying and they weren't ready and he was like, "You know what? Let's just uh let's put let's put the doll in." And I
44:42
was like, "Okay." And I was like, "All right." And and and I have the doll. And I remember and I made a joke on set and
44:47
I was like I was like uh I just saved you 35 grand cuz I moved his his uh his hand with my thumb,
44:54
you know, like I saved visual effects like 50 grand like made a joke about it and then we got to post and we were in
45:00
Vancouver uh at the doing the meeting but you know everybody defers to the boss and I still remember being in a in
45:07
a room and I'm like a theater we're watching and they're like okay Clint so we did this and uh you know the tank has
45:13
dirt on it and you know whatever visual effects they had And we get to the baby,
45:18
they're like, "Okay, Clint, this is uh this scene and it ends." And I'm literally behind Clint. I just see the
45:23
back of his head. And I'm waiting for everybody to raise their hand. Like, "We got to spend more money the
45:30
kid real." And uh I think the kid had like two fingers, too. Like they weren't even It was like an A. Yeah, that's it.
45:36
It is. Yeah, that's it. That's me. I'm doing that. That's it.
45:41
But dude, it's kind of dope. I love it. Now I've come full circle. So So and I
45:47
raised my hand and I was like, "Clint, I just think that it's clear, you know, that that's not a baby and what would do
45:54
we can we at least just find out what the cost would be?" And no one and no one said anything. And then I remember
46:01
he was like, "I think I think we move on." Wow. And that was it, dude. And that was it.
46:07
And I was like, "Okay, okay." And I remember talking to the other producer. I was like, "This is going to come
46:12
back." I was like, "Bro, this is going to come back to haunt us." And I remember he said, "No, Bradley, you're too close to
46:17
the movie." I was like, "I don't think so, dude." No. Everybody was like, "He's moving his thumb. This is crazy. That's a rubber
46:24
baby." Crazy, dude. There's another one, too. When like a Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's crazy. What is it like doing a film like
46:30
that where you're playing an actual human being? Is that is that different
46:36
than a like a written character that has no physical body that you you you can
46:41
kind of become who you think the words represent? Yeah. But when you're playing a guy like Chris
46:46
Kyle, you're you're playing a human. Yeah. And you're trying to figure out a way to
46:52
make it as realistic as possible, but your acting is like, what is that like?
46:58
I mean, the the thing that just popped my head is the pressure is is it's like night and day because there are people
47:06
that you have to um serve, you know, especially with Chris
47:12
Kyle. We started making that movie. He was alive. He got killed while we were he was still
47:19
negotiating with Warner Brother. I think he we just closed his deal and then he was murdered on February 2nd, I believe.
47:27
And uh and it was just like whoa. And um and then but in fact we were like now we
47:32
really got to make this movie. And um and then Clint and I flew to Midlotheian, Texas and met with his
47:39
family and his widow and his parents and then the kids. And I had played I play I did the Elephant Man. I did as a play in
47:46
my thesis in grad school and then I did it at Williamstown and then I actually did it in New York and London. So, and that and even though it's a long time
47:52
ago, that was the first time I felt that responsibility because I actually loved that guy, Joseph Merrick, and I did and
47:58
I felt that responsibility to him. So, I had done something like that before. But this was the first this was the next
48:04
time. It was massive, Joe. But I think that that it's like you're always looking for
48:10
what's the fuel that's going to allow me to work as hard as I can. And the fuel when you're playing a real person is
48:16
like there's like four extra canisters or like vats of firepower for you to
48:22
work hard because you just, you know, you're looking across at the eyes of somebody say, "I'm going to serve your son or
48:29
your husband or your father." It's a major responsibility, maybe even more major because he's now
48:34
he's deceased. Yeah, it was it was it was mindblowing. Um but and it terrified me. And also
48:42
like I'm 185 lbs at that point from northeast Philadelphia. This guy's from
48:47
Midlotheian, Texas, Sealed Team 3. You know, it's like how and and the way Clint works, the way we did work, you
48:54
know, Kevin Lace, who was a SEAL team 3 with Chris was in the movie. He played Dober. Jacob Shiko was one tribe, which
49:00
is what I'm wearing. He was a Marine that and Did you ever see American Sniper? Yes. Yeah. There's that scene where he goes
49:05
to the hospital and there's all the guys that have been wounded. Jacob Shik is one of them, you know. So, there's real guys. It's all real. So, I step in, you
49:13
know, I've got to I I'm gonna die unless I believe I'm Chris,
49:19
right? Like, so I have to do whatever I can so that I believe I'm Chris. If I believe
49:24
I'm Chris, then I have a shot at everybody else potentially going along
49:29
with this illusion. I just have to I have to be absolutely fearless when I walked on set. So I just it just made me
49:37
work so hard that I had never worked hard that if it's a created character
49:43
you know it's it's different but it comes with a different set of challenges you know it depend it just depends on what it is but I do know and then with
49:49
Leonard Bernstein he did the same thing huge responsibility like massive that I felt right
49:54
to his kids right to people that loved him um but but ma mainly his kids all three his son has
50:00
passed away since but his three kids are like okay you know they're like handing you you know So it's like if someone
50:06
went to your daughter in 12 years and said, "Here's this movie about your father." Do you know what I mean?
50:11
Yeah. You know, and and this guy's sitting across and be like, "Okay, I'm going to play your father." That's just a whole
50:18
other thing because the truth is like if it's good, it's going to last a long time and it's
50:24
going to be a thing that marks their journey, right? So I'm a part of whatever little part of
50:29
Chris's journey. So you give somebody you the faith that whoever has the power to give to that artist is just you know
50:38
so it just made me work you know like you just you just don't stop working till you get to the point where you believe you're him or you believe that
50:44
he's a part of you something's working. Did you meet Chris Kyle? Never just talked to him on the phone once.
50:50
Oh wow. Yeah. So what did you like what did you train
50:55
like what did you do to try to like Yeah. Well here's it's interesting right? It's like, well, I couldn't do anything that would ever achieve what he
51:01
achieved. But it's like, what can I do to look like a master, right? So,
51:07
there's three weapons, the 338, Leau, the 50 cal, the uh the uh rifle. It's
51:13
like, what can I do? How much time do I have? And I had like six months. Also, luckily, we're the same shoe size, same
51:19
age. He has a hole in his ear. I do. You find things that like, you know, uh same
51:25
height. I was like, "Oh, this is this is great." Uh, and then I just like, but he's 238 pounds. So, the first thing was 6,000
51:31
calories a day. Found a trainer and just 6,000. Yeah. 6,000 calories a day. You
51:36
first I did it with real food and that was a big mistake because I couldn't get up. I remember
51:42
the first week I did it had an incredible chef and and and then I would I couldn't get up. Like I couldn't move
51:48
like I couldn't move my stomach. So then we I think we split like half of it into protein shakes, but it was still 6,000
51:55
calories. You say you couldn't get up like what do you mean? My stomach wasn't able to process that much food.
52:00
Yeah. Whatever whatever happened I could just getting blocked. Getting blocked like major pain like I was giving birth or something. What I
52:07
would imagine. So then we changed it and it would be like huge meal shake. Huge
52:12
meal shake. Worked out twice a day. Five. I had three rest days, no cardio.
52:17
It was all about strength training like and then and it was all focused around deadlifting. Oh, okay. And uh it was this guy Jason
52:24
Walls who I worked with and um and I did that. Yes. It would be like Monday t Monday 5:30 a.m. and then a 4:30 p.m. or
52:32
like 3:30 Monday Tuesday rest Wednesday Thursday Friday rest Saturday Sunday and
52:37
did that. And I got up to 238 pounds. And a lot of it was like because I was thinking about him, his neck and my so I
52:43
gained like I would do all these all the neck stuff and it was his shoulders like I just wanted so you could shoot over
52:49
and it's like you know which we did all the time in the movie where the guy's just you know Chris. Yeah. NFL playoffs.

Um, how much weight did you gain? I went from 185 to 238. Whoa. Yeah. And all naturally, cuz I cancer's
54:26
in my family. I've had skin cancer and like I'm terrified of anything. So I was like not going to do that. Um, so you
54:34
know, you take creatine or anything? I took creatine. Yeah. Which, by the way, I just started again like three
54:39
months ago. Oh, it's amazing, dude. I'm on this push-up thread with a bunch of dads at my school and we do a
54:46
100 push-ups a day and if we don't, you have to pay $10 into a pool and then when we get to 800, we go to Chinatown.
54:51
I'll have a meal with the money. And then I started taking creatine like two and a half months ago. And uh, we just
54:57
upped it to 150. I was like, "This is cuz I could only do and we like YouTube the perfect push-up, which I didn't know, which is like a whole other
55:03
world." Uh, and then now it's it's I mean, creatine is incredible. It's incredible for your brain as well.
55:09
I know. I've I've heard you say that. Like I can't tell that because I also take Zins all the time. So, it's like I don't know what's doing it.
55:17
Yeah, me too. I do the same thing. Um, but but um yeah, where was I on the
55:22
Chris thing? You were talking about gaining weight and Oh, yeah. So then I worked with and I worked with the guy who So it was
55:27
doing that in conjunction with um learning about sniping and uh working with Kevin Lac's guy
55:34
Dober. We would go up to the Disney ranch and work with like 600 yard head targets prone that I would just do all
55:39
the time. And then we then once we cast the rest of the team we did all this stuff. But really Kevin Lace, this guy
55:45
Dober was the guy cuz he was there and he was there through the whole shooting just so everything would be real. And we
55:50
just drilled it. we became a group like you know we did the work but it wasn't so much about like I was like I have this amount of time doing
55:57
like SEAL boot camp will do nothing for me like like that that'll just give me the brain like how hard this is and will I
56:03
be broken I've done not that I couldn't have not maybe I would have been broken but I felt like I do understand that
56:10
like I've been through certain things where like I understand what it's like to push myself to be on my breaking
56:15
point and what that looks like and feels like. What I don't know is when I'm looking at a target and I have to factor
56:22
in the, you know, the curve of the earth, you know, like that's the stuff I want to learn. Yeah.
56:27
Um, so that's where I focused was those three weapons, you know, live rounds gaining the weight. So I felt like I was
56:34
with Here we go. We're back. Um, that's like all of a sudden you're like, "Oh, you didn't take the drug."
56:44
You know what I'm saying? Um like no I'm not on it. Um and then
56:50
and then so it was those two things in conjunction. The curve of the earth is nuts to think about that. It's crazy.
56:55
Long distance stayed up 24 hours would pee in there, you know, never get up to pee, just pee
57:01
right there, right in the room, you know? I mean, I said no. And then by the way, it's a human be. I mean, it's just
57:06
Yeah, forget it. Um and then just working with this guy Tim Monik on like his voice to me. It's
57:12
all the voice is everything. It's all about the voice and like where he's from. And Chris was interesting because his accent started to change, you know,
57:19
because he once he got out and then he did that um he did a couple of shows, you know, he wrote that book which is
57:25
how I came across and then gave it to Clint. Um so he had an interesting accent that
57:30
kind of changed a little bit. Um but yeah, just the voice just hitting the voice. I would work this guy five days a
57:35
week, you know, you know, and I had I had tons of stuff. I had so much information that TA Kyle had been so
57:43
generous to give me so many home videos, you know, correspondence, you know, I
57:48
had I used to work out to his which I just did the other day. I hadn't It's so funny we're talking about this. I literally just did it two days ago. Um
57:55
worked out to his playlist. I had both of his workout playlists. Oh wow. And I and I and I blew up two huge
58:01
posters and one was him just like this and one with his gun. And I would do that and look at him every morning. It
58:07
was just like this beautiful ritual that I felt like I was with him every day. How long did you take to prepare?
58:12
I I I'd have to look back. I think I I did it fast, but I think we had about 6 months or 5 months, but like, you know,
58:18
full on that's it. Nothing else. I didn't have a kid back then. It was like that was it. Yeah. Yeah.
58:23
That's There's There's something very unique about someone doing a film about an actual person. Yeah. Like a great
58:30
actor doing like Dairo when he played Jake Lamada, Raging Bull, of course. like that. That was one of
58:36
the first like I mean he became a different person. Yeah. Yeah. You have to
58:42
Yeah. You have to there's like a merging of you and that whatever that idea the soul whatever of the person it sounds so
58:48
hokey you know I get it but if you ask me what my memory is of of making a
58:53
sniper like memory like on in scenes it's not that like I was acting
59:00
it's just that's not my memory. What is the memory of like, okay, now we're going to do this and it's like me as him doing it.
59:08
Wow. You know, that's that's Was that a mind [ __ ] when you stop when like the movie?
59:14
Well, the good thing is you do a Clint who takes the piss out of [ __ ] everything. Oh, does he? Yeah. So, we would go to dinner at night
59:21
and uh and I learned from Christian Bale and American Hustle like he just stayed in because I didn't understand this stay
59:26
in the character all the time. You know, you hear these stories but you don't know what the real is. Like how does that work? You see a cell phone, do you like lose your mind? like how do you
59:33
what is it? How do you do it? And Bale it's like oh I overthought it. Bale would just stay. He was played this
59:38
character that's from New York in in American Hustle and I'd go in there the first day I met him he was his accent
59:44
and the rest of the movie even like on weekends it was the it was him Christian and I could we would talk about stuff
59:50
and his kid but he would just speak in that voice and I was like oh it's that simple like
59:55
it's not some big thing like once you get the voice that is weird you know but I took it I mean and it's
1:00:01
wonderful because then you feel like you're not acting and you're in the voice and I do it all like so so I would
1:00:06
be in that voice of Chris for the whole movie and then we would go to like a restaurant when we were like up in Lancaster shooting or something and
1:00:12
Clint would then make fun of me in my accent as Chris and order a steak and it was just it was it was great. Yeah,
1:00:18
he's [ __ ] sabotaging your performance. He's making you self-conscious. That's crazy.
1:00:23
It was awesome. That's crazy. I I always wondered what it's like to be around someone who's like method whether
1:00:29
it I don't know that's I wouldn't you know method is also a term that you know what does it mean? Well, the method what
1:00:35
hap it started in Russia, right? And then uh um you know that book uh on acting that I should know um you know
1:00:43
what's his name? He came and then the group theater started and it was like you know and all
1:00:48
these people then disband and there's Harry Meisner and there's Yeah. Stannislovski. Exactly. And there was
1:00:54
this other guy Vangov that also talked about uh that every rehearsal. It's very interesting. I read all this in grad
1:01:00
school and then the group theater came in and then Elilia Kazan was a huge part
1:01:05
of it becoming popular because you had this guy that was sweeping floors of the actor studio and then started directing plays and then all of a sudden he's a
1:01:11
huge movie director and he's putting Marlon Brando who was part of the actor studio starring in his movies you know
1:01:18
and and he's doing and so it all just sort of erupted but then it branched out and so there's people that are dogmatic
1:01:25
about it about it's only using you're, you know, you're substituting. So if I'm doing a scene with you, like you aren't
1:01:30
you, you're my brother, you know, right? But but but it's evolved into it's like what works for you. To me, it's like you
1:01:36
use your your own experience plus your imagination, you know? But that's that's the sort
1:01:42
that's the you know, sort of a very layman's 50-second uh you know telling of what the origin
1:01:49
of the method is. But I went to the actor studio which is based in the method. That's where I went to grad school.
1:01:55
Um is it And it's very valuable cuz I didn't know [ __ ] before that. I mean, I I did a couple of plays at Georgetown. I
1:02:01
didn't know any I mean, I just loved acting, but I didn't do anything about it. I was terrified as a kid. Like, we
1:02:07
did this thing in high school where we had to as seniors, we would put on our show where we would make fun of our teachers. And I like I could do my Latin
1:02:14
teacher, Mr. Burke. I was like, and I actually sang in it. We sang and I was like, but I was terrified, Joe, for the
1:02:19
whole year. Sleepless nights for a year leading up to it. That's how scared I was in public. I remember doing like a
1:02:24
fifth grade presentation with the poster boards about lock and hobs and the poster shaking so hard because I was
1:02:30
because I was so nervous. I was like how am I going to what's this fear thing? Isn't that weird? I know. But then in college I did a
1:02:36
couple of plays but I still didn't know what I was doing but I loved it and I was like little stuff. I was like Azilon
1:02:41
the server in Dangerous Liaons. But I still remember like I closed the door in a rhythm rhythmic way and people laughed
1:02:48
and I remember I was like I was this feels good and then and then so I
1:02:53
applied to grad school there and then all of a sudden it was like I got a huge
1:02:59
foundation of like what I could do. You know that your insecurities are actually your attributes, your fears are stuff
1:03:04
that you know all this thing that you you're a sensitive kid. This is all good stuff. And I never felt that way before
1:03:10
about any of that. And I had this teacher, Elizabeth Kemp, who was incredible, who then passed away in my house years
1:03:16
later. She got sick. Yeah. Crazy. Passed away in your house? Yeah. In Venice, California. She was sick. So, we put her hospice there. But,
1:03:24
um, she was incredible. And she did this basic technique class. And it was the first time ever because I didn't, you
1:03:29
know, grow up therapy or and none of that was even, you know, in the vicinity of talking about your feelings. you
1:03:36
know, my I loved my dad, but I grew up in, you know, the 80s in northeast Philadelphia with an Irish Italian
1:03:42
upbringing that wasn't part of the deal. And um and then all of a sudden in grad
1:03:47
school with other guys and women and we're like laying down and she wants us to go through an experience of loss and
1:03:53
betrayal when we were children, it's like what the [ __ ] And actually I could take all that stuff I've been ashamed of
1:03:58
and it I could use it and bring it into art. I don't know. It really clicked with me. Wow. In a huge way. Um, so and I use it even
1:04:06
to this day. All the movies I do, I I always get the actors together and do like a workshop for a week that's based
1:04:12
on dreams that she also taught me. And I just find it invaluable. Any way you can just how can I just get to a place where
1:04:17
we're just talking to each other and I don't you know what and that all this stuff I feel it's okay.
1:04:23
Right. Right. Yeah. When you're doing a guy like Chris, it must also be kind of easier to keep the
1:04:29
accent than to try to reestablish it right before every scene. You just said it. It's a logical thing.
1:04:35
Yeah, that's it. It's a logical thing. The idea of me talking with an accent or
1:04:40
even thinking that it's an accent because you don't think about it anymore. The whole point is I'm not doing an act. If I'm doing a scene with
1:04:46
you and I'm thinking about how I'm talking, it's over. It's a wrap. It's not real.
1:04:51
Right. But if I'm just talking to you and it it happens to be the voice that I've been working on for however long
1:04:57
time, then we're in it. We got a shot. And if I'm stopping it, there's no way I'm not thinking about
1:05:04
So yes, Joe, that is the reason. You know what's a really underappreciated talent is voice actors
1:05:11
who do audiobooks. I was watching a video of this guy cuz I never knew how
1:05:16
they did it and I kind of assumed that whenever they had to change accents,
1:05:21
they probably had a pause or they were did. But there's a there's a video of a
1:05:27
guy doing the voice over for Lord of the Rings, the Lord of the Rings audio book, and he goes into Smeaggel. He goes into
1:05:33
the Gollum character while he's doing narration. There's no break. He just smoothly transitions into [ __ ]
1:05:41
incredible. It is absolutely masterful and completely underappreciated.
1:05:48
Yeah, I agree with you. Because if you watch this guy do it, I I I don't know the gentleman's name who's the voiceover
1:05:53
actor, but I love audiobooks. This that guy, listen to this guy.
1:05:58
Oh, it's Andy Circus. Was holding a debate with some other thought that used the same voice but
1:06:05
made it squeak and hiss. A pale light and a green light
1:06:11
alternated in his eyes as he spoke.
1:06:19
It's me promised, said the first thought.
1:06:27
Yes. Yes, my precious
1:06:32
came the answer. Amazing. [ __ ] amazing. Like that.
1:06:37
What a master. Have it. And you're talking about a master actor.
1:06:43
Yes. Yeah. You know, cuz he's been in a lot of movies. He's directed. He directed that great movie. Uh that was like uh
1:06:48
Jungle Book, a version of Jungle Book that Christian Bale actually played the Panther, I believe. He's incredible. And
1:06:54
I got to meet him. He He's like This guy's like a one-off generational talent. Yeah, he's insane.
1:07:00
You have to be to be that good at voiceover acting. And he's a great actor. Yeah, you have to be.
1:07:06
Yeah. Yeah. I I agree. And my mother watches this uh She'll kill me that I'm
1:07:12
My mother watches, first of all, she loves Turkish soap operas, so she watches every Turkish operas. Oh yeah,
1:07:17
yeah, yeah. Why them specifically? I don't know. She just she graduated from Hallmark into Turkish submers
1:07:25
and she channel and uh and then she's evolved even further. She just watches a screen
1:07:32
where there's two people AI images and it's just a person telling a story. And I often I'll come down making breakfast
1:07:38
because when she stays with me in New York, she has the room down there and I'll be like making my daughter breakfast and I could hear it or I'll go
1:07:44
to the bathroom which is right next to her and I was like wow these guys these voices. I mean because the guy's carrying it all just an image and she'll
1:07:50
watch it for hours and I'm like what's going to happen? Is he going to make that? Is the firm going to hire him? Is she gonna Did she see
1:07:56
the note? Like he's it's amaz I was like yeah it's really an art form Turkish.
1:08:02
Yeah. I remember the first time I came down, I was like, "Oh no, what happened?" Because I'm just hearing I'm like, "What happened?" And I walk in and
1:08:08
I'm like, "Mom, what are you what are you watching?" She's like, "Oh no, this guy's the best actor in the world, this guy." And so she just reads the
1:08:16
subtitles. She did it for like she's watch. It's called um h
1:08:24
if you look up uh he's like, what's it called? Circle. Uh,
1:08:31
is it dove bird? B bird something.
1:08:36
How could I forget it? Early bird. Oh, baby. Is that it? Early bird. Early bird.
1:08:41
Oh, yeah. And Oh, yeah. Explain this. So, it's a soap. It's a soap opera. There's like 360 episodes. She's watched
1:08:48
them all like five, four times. And she'll come in. She'll like do a marathon session, come in to make some
1:08:54
food. just like I said this guy just the way he moves. This guy's the best actor.
1:09:01
That's him. That's him. Yeah, that's him. Is it speaking in Turkish with
1:09:08
hear some of this? This looks like um Yeah, that's it.
1:09:13
Yeah, there he is.
1:09:19
Yeah, there he is. And so she likes this and she does the
1:09:24
voice over. She she reads the No. So that's that's that was the middle stage. Now she's graduated to it's
1:09:30
different now where she just watches two AI images and it's a story. But she did this for a good like eight
1:09:36
years. But all through co Why was she into this? I don't know. She must have come across it one day on somewhere and then that
1:09:43
was it. She just got hooked. Oh, I mean hooked isn't even the word. Yeah. By the way, it's pretty good. Is
1:09:50
it? Yeah. Yeah. You watch it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's great. And the woman in it is great, too. Yeah.
1:09:56
Do you consume a lot of films? Do you watch a lot? I watch a lot of everything. Yeah. I love television uh films. And then,
1:10:04
you know, like eight months ago, I I know I'm late to the game. Came across podcasts.
1:10:10
Only eight months ago. Yeah, pretty much. Yeah. Yeah. That's interesting, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah.
1:10:15
What What made you get into that?
1:10:21
I can't remember, but it was your podcast and I'm trying to think what it was and then and then it was like oh and
1:10:26
then I came and then you know once you watch something on your phone it like suggests other things
1:10:31
and uh and then you had two guys on that I thought were really interesting and then they do a trigon trigonometry
1:10:37
and then I find that very fascinating. Oh, they're great. Yeah. Great. And so that's how it just started. So now it's like a huge part of
1:10:43
like I have this whole little thing like like often I'll go to bed and my daughter's listening to your voice. But
1:10:48
I do put on headphones sometimes because I love like just at the end of the day listening listening or watching I'll put
1:10:53
it on the side table. Yeah. It's I podcasts are incredible and it's very soothing. Very soothing.
1:10:59
That's interesting. I hardly ever listen to them anymore. I used I love I love TV. I love it. Yeah. I take in a lot of content.
1:11:06
Have you watched The Beast in Me on Netflix? Oh dude. Holy [ __ ] dude.
1:11:12
Dude, and that guy um Gary Russell's husband, Ma Matthew Reese, dude,
1:11:18
the the bad guy. Yeah, he's How [ __ ] good is that guy? So, I did a movie with him years ago called Burnt
1:11:24
about a chef and we had never met and there's a scene where my character he was trying to get sober and he's he went
1:11:30
off the wagon and he goes into this guy their old nemesis they were nemesis with each other his restaurant after hours
1:11:38
and um it was like a pretty dark scene that we never met me and this guy this actor right before we shot and I come in
1:11:47
and then I don't know what was I was pretty it was I was pretty locked in And there's one scene which wasn't really
1:11:53
scripted. I took, you know, those SUV bags and I put it over my head to try to cuz he's trying to kill himself, which
1:12:00
by the way, I was like, "Oh, this this could work if I don't get help. Those things are
1:12:06
strong and tight." And then we had this experience, Joe, where then he was ripping it off me trying to for me not
1:12:13
to kill myself. And I don't know him that well, but we had that's the thing about like making art together. like we
1:12:19
had that it'll never every time I see him I've seen him maybe six times at like certain things or something. I
1:12:26
always feel like we're bonded forever just based on this one experience that we had and he's an incredible actor. He's just
1:12:33
and he and I the end of that show him and the end of that dude and Claire Danes is like off the charts.
1:12:39
Did you see that show she did with Jesse Eisenberg? What's that? Um there's a there's another series she
1:12:45
did Homeland. No, no, no. It was like Flechman. The something with Flechman.
1:12:50
Fleshman is in trouble. Yeah, Flechman. There's this Yeah, she's incredible in that, too. There's a scene where she's basically having a mental
1:12:57
breakdown and you're watching and you're like, "This this can't be acting." Yeah. Fleshman is in trouble.
1:13:02
Yeah, it's on FX. I never even heard of this. Yeah, it's really good.
1:13:07
Yeah, I I enjoyed it, but And I enjoyed her at the end. There's one scene that like really rocked me where I just fully
1:13:13
I mean, that's like I just saw this movie Hamnit. I don't know if you guys saw that or not. No,
1:13:18
that's what I love about movie. So Jesse Buckley in this movie, it's she's basically playing like the most
1:13:24
difficult role ever, the loss and all that stuff. And I fully Joe full I'm watching and sitting there fully
1:13:30
believing that this person is going through this. Do you know what I mean? And like when you do that, when I believe that you're
1:13:37
actually going through it, I mean that's it. That's And like that her performance in that movie is so
1:13:43
She's so good, dude. Dude, dude. in in are you talking or Jesse Buckley now? Jesse No.
1:13:49
Claire Dan and Jesse Buckley. Yeah, they're both amazing. But Claire Danes is so good in The Beast in Me there there's there's moments
1:13:55
where like her [ __ ] lips are trembling, dude. No, she's touched. Her eyes are ding the level, right? Touched.
1:14:01
She's touched. Yes. No question. Yeah. No question. Yeah. She locks in in this very crazy way. She
1:14:08
was great in [ __ ] Homeland, too. Yeah. She never saw Homeland. Oh, it's great. It's really good. She
1:14:13
just locks in. She locks in in this very strange way where you [ __ ] 100%
1:14:19
believe her. Yeah. Like believe it behind the eyes. It's the greatest. I mean, that's what that that's the heroin for me of this
1:14:24
industry. It's like when you when you're around and you're creating this thing and it's just and all of a sudden it's like whoa. Yeah. Yeah.
1:14:30
Like holy [ __ ] it's happening. But it's like I had this conversation with Ethan Hawk. I was because I was asking him about
1:14:37
But I felt like that with Will just real quick. You know that vampire scene that's because I was I was operating it right. I I I don't know how you felt
1:14:43
watching it though. The scene when he was on stage at the very end. Yes. Yes. Yes. I was like I fully believed it.
1:14:49
Yes. And and those people and then when I went to the audience and they're just like cuz they didn't know what the [ __ ]
1:14:54
going on. Right. Right. Like that was one of those moments I had on this movie where I was like, "Oh, my man is locked." Yeah.
1:15:00
The [ __ ] Oh, 100%. Yeah. 100%. It was very uncomfortable for me. You felt that?
1:15:05
Yeah. Yes. Oh, 100%. Definitely. That I was I have this conversation with Ethan Hawk about that. I go, "What is happening
1:15:12
when I believe someone?" Like I was talking about the scene in um that movie with him and Julia Roberts, the about
1:15:19
the end of the world. Yeah, of course. There's a there's a scene with him and Kevin Bacon.
1:15:24
Yeah. When they go to the house and also uh there's three guys in that scene. Um Oh my god, he's amazing. Yeah. From
1:15:30
Moonlight and he's been in tons of stuff. Uh Green Book. I know him.
1:15:36
Yeah. Jamie will pull it up. I can't I'll [ __ ] his name up if I pronounce it. Sorry.
1:15:41
What is it? Sorry. Um Oh, it's a Marshall Ali.
1:15:47
That's it. Ali. Yes. Um I believe it. I know that's Kevin Bacon.
1:15:53
I know that's Ethan Holl. I believe he's going to shoot him. Yeah. No question. I believe it. Like I go, "What is that?" Like what is going on? I go cuz is it
1:16:01
It's almost like a form of hypnosis. And he's like, "Yes, that's it. You have to
1:16:06
actually be there. You act you have to actually be there. Like yeah, you're saying the lines you're supposed to say,
1:16:14
but what's happening is like you really are there. You really believe it. And that if you don't believe it, the
1:16:20
audience doesn't believe it. And we've all been there before. Like one time I ate an edible and I went to go see uh
1:16:26
one of those Marvel movies and in the I was really high. And while I was watching the movie, I like this guy's
1:16:33
acting. You know, it's just like it just made,
1:16:38
you know, when you're really sensitive and tuned in. I get angry cuz I'm like, I want to I want to go on the ride. I'm like the best watcher cuz I want I want when that
1:16:44
thing starts, I want to go on the ride. I want to go on the ride. Yes. Like like him and Denzel in Training
1:16:50
Day. Yeah. Like that. There's a few scenes where you're like, "Okay, this is really in the car."
1:16:56
Yes, that's the one. Yes, this is really happening. Like this is real. Yeah, Hawk's so good in that movie.
1:17:02
Yeah, he's he's great. Yeah, he's great and everything, but he's sick in that movie. But he's also when you talk to him, you
1:17:09
realize, okay, this is an actual artist. Yeah, he's a unique dude. Yeah. Yeah. He's not a guy like trying to be a movie
1:17:15
star. He's an artist that does movies. Yeah. But I don't know how many people I don't know. It's like how many comedians
1:17:22
who just want to be famous are gonna I I don't even know how you could do it. You have to love it, right? It's just too
1:17:27
hard. That's not enough of a fuel. It's It's not that how that's just not
1:17:32
enough fuel. It won't take you far enough. It's just not a fuel to keep doing it, right? Because if you don't love it, I think
1:17:37
you would find it monotonous and maybe boring and tedious and inconsequential.
1:17:42
You're going on a road trip with an eighth of a tank of gas. You're not going to make it. You're not going to make it. You're stomping on the gas and trying to
1:17:48
pull out of the parking lot, but it's not that. Yeah. It's a long drive. And my experience in the 26 years I've been in this is like
1:17:55
most of the people if not all that I've worked with, they love it. Yes. They love it. They have to. Otherwise, Yeah.
1:18:01
If you want to be great at something, you have to love it. Yeah. I can't I can't imagine. Yeah. Cuz it's not even that you want. Yes.
1:18:07
You want to be great at it, but you just love doing it, right? That's it. Right. And the love is how it becomes
1:18:13
great. And then the fear is when you get famous or people get popular early that can be confusing because you start to
1:18:21
have like um I have to maintain a certain you start getting careful like I
1:18:26
was thinking about when you said like what is that thing when it just it's hypnosis. The key to that is willing to fail.
1:18:33
That's what I learned as an actor is like oh yeah just don't take it too seriously.
1:18:38
Here we go. We're rolling the camera. We can f let's just here let's see what happens. I'm going to go out on a limb. Maybe it won't work, but like, yeah, be
1:18:45
willing to like completely fail. And the minute you do that, it's like, oh, and all of a sudden,
1:18:52
there's this reservoir of space in your head and your soul to actually
1:18:58
create even more of an of an imaginary circumstances. Now, if you haven't done your work, you're [ __ ] anyway.
1:19:04
But like, but once you're there, it's like once you're like, "Oh, yeah, everybody, we could just fail. Let's just let's just fail."
1:19:09
How do you Does that make sense? Do you know what I'm saying? 100% makes sense. It makes sense because the only way you're going to really find out what it
1:19:15
is is to like try it all kinds of ways. Yeah, that we I was just having the conversation, you know, Brian Ken, our
1:19:22
mutual friend, uh he he texted me last night. He's like, "I got a new bit and I just ate a dick. I have to go up on
1:19:28
stage with it tonight. It's [ __ ] terrible." He goes, "But I know there's something in there." And we were we were talking on the phone right before the
1:19:33
show. He's like, "Dude, my [ __ ] new [ __ ] is bombed. It ate dick last night. I don't know what to do." I go, "But I know there's something there." It's like
1:19:40
you've got to be willing to bomb. You got to be willing to eat a dick.
1:19:45
If you don't, I don't know how. Yeah. I don't know any. If you're careful, you're it's you're it's over. You can't.
1:19:50
Careful is death. I talked to Chris Rock once and he told me that that bit that he did that was one of his all-time classic bits. I love
1:19:58
black people. I hate n-word. Right. Right. He goes that bit bombed for like a year.
1:20:03
Right. He couldn't get couldn't get it to work. He's like, "I know there's something in there, but I have to find it." And it
1:20:10
took a [ __ ] year. And think, we're talking about a year of going up at the store, going up at the
1:20:16
improv, going here, going to the Laugh Factory, going here, going there. [ __ ] Pulling your hair out. [ __ ] Trying to
1:20:22
figure it out. A [ __ ] year, man. And when you're Chris Rock, you're already
1:20:28
Chris Rock. And you for, you know, you could talk about getting your dick sucked. You talk about something. people will laugh and you're like, I think
1:20:34
there's something here. I got to grind this [ __ ] thing down until I get an edge to it.
1:20:40
And it took him a year. Yeah. Like, you have to be willing to [ __ ] around and to suffer through all that.
1:20:46
Yeah. And enjoy the suffering. You start to like on once you do it enough, fail enough in front of people, it starts to
1:20:53
be easier. Yeah. And then you come out on the other end, you're like, "Yeah." And I'm still alive. I'm still alive. Yeah. Glad I did it.
1:20:58
Well, this wasn't as big as I thought. No. And then you have to do it again. That's and then you put out a special and then once you put out a special you
1:21:05
start from scratch and then you're [ __ ] terrified because now you're a famous comedian with no material or
1:21:11
terrible material and you have to figure out a way to make it good. And that plays into what I was talking about like when you have when you've
1:21:17
achieved something and then there's that pressure you put on yourself that it has to be that good or better,
1:21:22
right? And then all of a sudden you're in a different game than than just like the doing. I think
1:21:28
that that play it safe game is the scariest game or yeah or or somehow think that it's it's somehow that controllable because
1:21:35
really all this stuff we're talking about it's really kind of out of our control you know when it's working I
1:21:41
don't feel in control at all right you feel like a passenger yeah and that's by the way that's the
1:21:46
high uh there's nothing fun about controlling everything there's no fun in that but when you're like whoa wait a second
1:21:52
what's happening like the zone is being a passenger it's like being an observer of something
1:21:57
sports too. I think it it works in every field. It's like they talk about it, you know. It's like, yeah, that's it. That's
1:22:03
it. And it just takes a ton a year of doing the thing, you know, because there are moments that I can even think of
1:22:09
where because you do think like it's okay. It doesn't matter. There are a couple where like actually if this moment doesn't work out, like it
1:22:16
may not be over, but you're definitely going to go down along the ladder. Yes. You know, and it's like, okay. And
1:22:22
that's that pressure, you know. Yeah. You got to love it. How do you pick a
1:22:28
project? Like how do you decide what you want to do and how much time do you spend deliberating on it?
1:22:36
Because you're in a unique position where you can do a lot of things. Yeah. You can kind of do whatever you want. So it's like what gets your juices going?
1:22:44
Like how do you decide what to do? It's all about um something igniting in me
1:22:51
that uh like for example uh when I was little I thought like I always obsessed with Vietnam. I was
1:22:59
obsessed as a kid Vietnam the war in Vietnam and my math teacher was uh was a recon
1:23:05
in Vietnam Bill Calm and I was like obsessed with this guy and he he was fascinating fascinating. He was a pole
1:23:12
vulture and he that was his cue for the chalkboard was a broken one of his broken pole vault um sticks.
1:23:18
Oh wow. And he would always and he always wore sweatpants and he would lean against the thing. So all day long half of his
1:23:25
sweatpants would be full of chalk and he would always smoke cigarettes on the athletic field and stand on the bench
1:23:32
and so he'd always be perched there and like my dad he would never put out his butts. He would always save them. So he
1:23:37
always smelled like like tobacco his hands and I and then my this other guy
1:23:43
came his father came and talked about this book Guns Up which is an incredible book about machine gunner in Vietnam.
1:23:48
So, and then I asked my dad if I could go to the military academy. Like I would just something and then like you know
1:23:53
Thin Red Line destroyed me. Terrence Malik movie and Apocalypse Now I was like obsessed with and all these films.
1:24:00
Um and so I always wanted to do something about I always felt like I had a love enough and an interest enough
1:24:06
that playing a soldier would be something that I felt like I had a reservoir. So that led me to Chris.
1:24:13
Wow. That was that. Um it's all specific things. It was just Joseph Merrick, you
1:24:18
know, the alpha man. Like when I was I had no money and I took it I got a one I'm T tower air went to London uh and
1:24:23
like tracked his his steps at hospital road and where he went out just cuz I was obsessed with this guy Joseph
1:24:29
Merrick the elephant man and then wound up you know then making it you know doing the play at Broadway
1:24:35
where they originated you know and then um Stars Born was really about I just
1:24:41
love I I always wanted to direct I don't think I dreamt that big but I I really realized what I loved about the process
1:24:48
of the industry I'm in is the making of it. I never felt like I fit in just acting. I never felt like I thought like
1:24:54
the first like like you like I went to LA with a job. Like I went to grad school in New York. I thought I'd just
1:25:00
be a theater actor if I was lucky. If I can make a living as an actor, I this is a home run. My dad was terrified, you
1:25:06
know, because he came from North Philadelphia, only guy to come out of the neighborhood kind of. There were a couple other guys, but then he became a
1:25:11
stock broker and then his son's going to do acting and be 70 grand in debt uh in
1:25:17
grad school, you know, Fanny May, thank God, but like, you know, and I didn't know if I was going to pay it off. And
1:25:23
but but that said, I we we grew up like upper middle class, but still I was like, I'm paying for grad school. I took a loan out and then so he was terrified.
1:25:30
And then I got a job on the show, Alias, that brought me to LA, but the minute I got there, I didn't know anything about Check the Gate. I knew nothing. You know
1:25:37
what I mean? I knew nothing. I just loved movies. And so I was obsessed, Joe. Obsessed. I would go in the editing
1:25:43
room and I found LA very hard when I was when I went there. I got very depressed. I was like, "This is high school all
1:25:49
over again." Holy. I was like, "What the I mean, I could I went to grad school. I'm in New York City. There's guys that
1:25:55
I could relate to and talk about movies." I was in heaven. Then I get this job that I think is going to be the
1:26:01
holy grail. And I'm miserable living in the first floor of this woman's house
1:26:06
just like it was crazy. I was like I didn't know I could be this depressed. I
1:26:11
mean depressed like I need water and like the idea of going to the right on um on uh Sunset and and Fairfax was like
1:26:19
too much. Yeah. And uh Yeah, that was rough. It's depressing when you first go
1:26:25
especially when you're in that weird environment and no one just No.
1:26:30
And I was on a show that was awesome and everybody's exploding and like no one it was like who the who's this guy? So that
1:26:36
not only that I'm there and everybody's like you know I'm just like you know a ghost. Right. Right. Right.
1:26:41
So there's that. So your insecurity is just you know exemp is is just you know astronomical.
1:26:47
It was for me it was also one of the first times that I ever moved somewhere where I didn't know anyone. I Me too. I knew nobody. J.J. Abrams
1:26:54
hired me and and then Berky, this guy was the only guy that I knew that he introduced me to and then I met Jennifer
1:27:00
Garner was like the second person I met and then Yeah. I didn't know anybody. It's weird.
1:27:05
Yeah. I remember I was on the set of the show. Oh, Brian Kugman. I didn't know that guy who's like one of my best friends. You
1:27:11
know Brian Clugman? No, I know who he is though. Yeah. He's We've grew up since we were like nine. Oh, wow. Yeah. Um, I was on the set of the show
1:27:18
and um, a girl gave me a hug and I realized no one had touched me in weeks.
1:27:24
And the hug she gave me, I was like, it it was like my battery got recharged.
1:27:29
Like I didn't realize I needed a hug. You know, people people say, "Do you need a hug?" Like I never thought like
1:27:35
nobody needs a hug. No, I [ __ ] needed a hug. I got She's like, "Give me a hug." She hugged me. I was like, "Oh,
1:27:41
thank you." I felt so good. It's It's weird. It's a weird feeling. It's a It's a hell of a place to go.
1:27:47
Oh, it is like Wow. Yeah. Yeah. I I had a hard time. Well, the whole environment of LA is so
1:27:56
strange because you have the primary industry, if if it's not the primary
1:28:02
industry, it's most certainly driving all industries is a bunch of people trying
1:28:08
to make it, right? So, it's a bunch of people with a hole in their soul. They need to fill up with other people's
1:28:14
attention. And they're coming there to try to get attention. They're trying coming there to try to make it. And the
1:28:21
one thing that they have to do is audition. So, you have to try to be
1:28:26
accepted by someone. So, you'd be judged. You go in there and you get return. You get rejected over and over
1:28:33
and over again, which just fuels the same like need that's inside of you. it
1:28:39
like makes it even worse and everybody's concentrating on this one thing like trying to get success and then you
1:28:45
realize like oh my doctor wanted to be an actor oh the waiter's an actor like every everyone's trying to do this thing
1:28:51
where you have to get chosen so then people calculate how they behave and
1:28:57
talk and what their political philosophy is and their life philosophy is based on
1:29:04
becoming ingratiating themselves with casting directors and with executives like getting these
1:29:10
people to like you and then these people realize that. So they have like they they're controlling this the twigs that
1:29:16
work the puppet strings and it just becomes this very strange environment of
1:29:22
a a complete lack of any like real critical thinking and any real like uh
1:29:29
embracing any alternative perspectives on things. Everyone is just trying to align their stars correctly so that they
1:29:37
can make it. Mhm. I mean that weird my experience was more because I went there with a job.
1:29:42
Right. Right. And you know New York for me I don't know I went on 2,000 auditions. Like I
1:29:47
remember when I first booked a job was Sex in the City. I booked some commercials and extra work which was great. But the first job I booked I
1:29:53
remember I was like I was terrified because I got to the point where I was I was a door man at a hotel and I would
1:29:59
audition and that was a great life and I if I got a call back it was great. But then when I had to do it I remember literally like whoa whoa I have to do
1:30:06
like wait what? I'm actually to do it. Um, what was it? What was the first thing you It was I played Jake the Downtown Smoker
1:30:12
in the Sex in the City with Sarah Jessica Park and I couldn't drive uh standard. Never learned how to drive standard so they sent me to Odell
1:30:18
Odell's Driving School and all I thought about was like don't have her head hit the dashboard when we pull into the
1:30:23
corner and I still messed it up and they had another guy do it and then I just had to do this thing, you know, when the camera's here and you go, "You okay?"
1:30:30
You know, like you're pulling in. Yeah. But I work so hard on it. Um, no. But LA for me it was I think it for me at least
1:30:38
was the geography. You going from New York City where you know you can go to
1:30:43
bar 6 which is on 6th Avenue. No matter who you are you go there a couple friends like you just feel like you're
1:30:49
in a cool place or a place that's vibrant. LA it's like if I wasn't at
1:30:55
work I was in I was in that that first floor of the house or my car rental car.
1:31:01
Yes. And that was it. and like and and the world which I could feel because I was seeing posters everywhere and billboards
1:31:08
which I had never been except for driving to Atlantic City, you know, and seeing who was going to, you know, going
1:31:14
to be, you know, as a residency that it was really the stimulus the stimuli of
1:31:20
that city aesthetically and how compartmentalized it is. So what I felt like like it's if you're not in, you're
1:31:28
out, right? And I just remember thinking like some somebody somewhere in this town is having a ball right now and it's not me.
1:31:36
Do you know what I mean? And then that just leads to how can I cope, you know, and like, you know, not
1:31:42
getting into bars, clubs, you know, and like girls not really looking at you,
1:31:47
you know, and all that stuff. And all of a sudden it's like seventh grade and I'm 25 years old and it's like and I should
1:31:54
be happy because I paid by the end of this year I'm going to pay off my student loan but I'm [ __ ] miserable.
1:32:00
What's wrong with me? You know it. But to me it was the geography of it. You know, New York City is so wonderful
1:32:07
because no matter what you're thinking, like when I did The Alpha Man, I would take the subway to 42nd Street and my preparation for the play was getting off
1:32:13
the subway going to the theater because the amount of thousands of people that are forcing me to be present.
1:32:20
Yes. Was is wonderful. It was like doing a 12minute relaxation cuz you're just it's life
1:32:26
and you're get through you know and then by the time you get to this theater you're like okay you know but LA it's
1:32:33
like you're in your car and the thing you pull up to the studio the thing you walk and you know and then all of a
1:32:39
sudden it's like okay here we go and you're like okay hold on a second. Yeah. That thing that New York has that
1:32:46
LA doesn't have is all walks of life are all intertwined. You're walking down the
1:32:53
street together. There's a billionaire and a homeless guy and a [ __ ] you know, nerd dwell and an office worker
1:33:00
and everyone's walking to where they go and they walk into restaurants and they get in cabs and they get on the subway
1:33:06
and everybody intermingles. where in LA it's in your car, you drive to a place
1:33:12
and then you go to your house and you don't ever like and if some weird interaction happened
1:33:19
on set or someone said something you're like oh then you're just a home thinking about it right
1:33:24
do you know what I mean there's no like well I went on and did this after that you know and I actually took up golf which is crazy and I would play at the
1:33:31
Malibu had this public golf course and I would like I got to do something because I'm an early morning I I wake up early
1:33:36
I've always have so I'm up at like 5:30 and so I did like a 6:47 tea time with
1:33:42
these two guys and that was actually nice. I did that for 6 months and I would play but like you just try to find
1:33:47
something that you know I just need to interact and do something else. Something that makes you human. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. For me I was
1:33:53
But I have to say like I do love Oh, interesting. Michael Vartan who was on Alias. Huge. Did you ever play pool with
1:33:59
him? No. Oh, he was hu. No kidding. Yeah. Oh, I wish I met him.
1:34:04
Yeah, he would go all the time. Yeah. to that one place that had like tons of uh I'm sure you know it.
1:34:10
Probably Hollywood Billyards maybe. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hollywood Billiards was the spot. Yeah. Yeah. It's uh in New York that was a big
1:34:17
thing for me too. It like almost hijacked my comedy career because I was doing I was playing pool like eight
1:34:22
hours a day. I was playing in tournaments. I was traveling around and going to tournaments. And when I came to LA, that was like one of the few things
1:34:28
that made me that made sense to me. Like, oh, I get it. Pool players. I know pool players. I can hang out with them. They're normal people. That's a great
1:34:35
asset you had there. Some having something like that is martial arts was always like that huge some having something where you have
1:34:41
something that you do because if I was only doing that you'd lose your mind. I'd go crazy. And I went there and I fell in love with
1:34:47
the movie making the getting back to my original part and I would go and so I'd ask J.J. Abrams if I could sit in the
1:34:52
editing rooms. So I would basically shoot my one scene a week which was like hey how was your trip Sydney? you know,
1:34:59
I didn't have a big part, right? And then but I would spend the rest of the day in the editing rooms and then I would ask Ken Olen who was so generous
1:35:05
that one of the showrunners if I could just shadow him and just be around all the time and I would take and I would
1:35:10
take everybody's dailies home that back then it was in VHS tapes. It was Carl Lumley, Victor Garber, Ron Riiffken, all
1:35:15
these great Victor and Ron were from New York, these great New York New York actors that came out and I would just
1:35:21
watch their dailies and learn, you know, just learn and and I and that's when I was like, I love this. Like I [ __ ]
1:35:28
love this. Well, that's what I love. I love when people love things. Yeah. And I do, man. Like I can't get
1:35:34
enough of it. I am 100% fascinated with people that love what they do. I I can watch people
1:35:41
make furniture. There's a guy that I watch on YouTube who just makes desks and tables out of like what what is it
1:35:48
called? Live what is it called? When they take it when it has the actual
1:35:53
outline of the wood. What is it called? They take slabs. He takes like slabs of
1:35:58
walnut and makes these tables and he narrates while he's building it and describes the process of it and how he's
1:36:05
trying to precisely align all these joints and these, you know, he's like he's got pegs and holes and slide it
1:36:11
into place. Live edge slab. That's it. Live edge. That's the other great thing about what I get to do. So, you do a movie like a sniper and you get
1:36:17
to be with these people who have dedicated their lives to this thing and you're watching them do it. Like in
1:36:23
Maestro, I got to go with the London Symphony Orchestra. Each person since
1:36:28
they were four have been doing this and they're all unicorns. Do you know what I mean? And Stars Born, all these
1:36:35
musicians. It's like even burn, I got to go to these restaurants and and study under these people. I mean, that's the thing
1:36:41
that's like that's the greatest thing in the world. It's nuts. It's nuts. And like even this
1:36:46
movie, the access I got to have to the seller and all the stuff and all the people. It was like I learned so much
1:36:52
more than I ever knew. But it expands you as a human. Oh, no question. You know more about what it is to be a
1:36:58
human. Like, oh, there's a human who just plays the flute. Yeah. You know, we were talking in the green room last night about Andre 3000. Was
1:37:05
that was his name? I'm saying it right. Almost said 5000, but that's wrong. Andre 3000 from Outcast. He plays the
1:37:11
flute now. Yeah. That's all he does. He plays the flute. Like a friend of mine ran into him in um
1:37:17
downtown in um Colorado. He said he he was in in Denver just walking around
1:37:24
with his flute and no one was bothering him and he's like, "Holy [ __ ] he's just [ __ ] playing the flute."
1:37:30
Yeah. That's a guy who loves what he does. Just I mean, apparently he made an entire album where he just plays the
1:37:36
flute. Yeah. And he's just like not into doing anything else. Yeah. just into like being an artist and
1:37:43
playing the flute. Yeah, it's dope, right? Yeah. It's like, [ __ ] I wish I
1:37:48
was that guy. But you seem to be I mean, you did, you know, uh hunting and billiards and
1:37:53
already you've got like two up on most people besides what you already do. But I do things that are that I think
1:38:01
are going to ex help me figure out who I am. And I think the
1:38:08
only way you really figure out who you are is to do difficult things. Yeah. And when you're doing difficult things,
1:38:14
you kind of learn about yourself, you learn about, oh, why do I have this desire to take a shortcut? Why don't I
1:38:20
go with the long why don't I do it the right way? Like what what it is what is it about Oh, yeah. getting good at something.
1:38:25
I mean, I think me at my base, I'm very lazy. I think everybody is. I mean, it's a default setting.
1:38:31
Yeah. No question. Default setting for humans. Gogggins talks about it. Yeah. Like Gogggins talks about like one of the things about
1:38:36
Gogggins is he always talks about how when he was fat and lazy like he used to be fat and lazy now he's like the most
1:38:42
disciplined human that's ever lived and he forced himself to become that. Yeah, but his default say he goes he goes he
1:38:49
goes even now he goes sometimes I look at my shoes for like a half hour before foot pulls [ __ ] on.
1:38:54
Yeah. I mean I'll be doing something during the day and I'm like I can't wait till my daughter's in bed and I'm upstairs and I'm just laying down on the
1:39:00
couch and I'm just whatever's on. Yeah. And that's my goal for the day. I'm like, what's going on here?
1:39:06
Sometimes that's good, though. I I view that as a reset. I think it's
1:39:12
important. Yeah. I don't kill myself over it. But I do recognize
1:39:17
that there is a feeling. But then I look at, you know, I look at the sort of landscape. I'm like, well, it's hard for me to def to categorize myself as lazy
1:39:23
if I just look at the facts. Yeah. You know, but I do feel, and it's what you're saying, it's that default setting. Well, I think with everybody,
1:39:30
it's like normal for human beings to seek comfort because it's difficult to acquire, especially in tribal societies
1:39:38
back when we were just hunter gatherers and just trying to figure out how to stay alive. Like the idea of relaxation
1:39:44
was impossible. And if you could get that's what I want. I want to stop chasing antelope just [ __ ] take a
1:39:51
nap. Or maybe they found a relaxed state in that because you when you're doing those things, you know, for a long
1:39:57
period of time, I feel like I am relaxed in that, but it just takes a lot of work. Yeah.
1:40:02
You know, a lot of over and over. But the best the the true high is when you're doing these things where it first
1:40:08
started out and you were horrible at it and then all of a sudden you're going out on a hunt or whatever and you're
1:40:13
like, I'm relaxed. I've never relaxed on a hunt. Well, I've never hunted so I
1:40:19
It's not a relaxing thing. I mean it is a a fulfilling I think I mean physically relaxed like
1:40:25
your body is not tense like because the one thing I do know you can't shoot a gun if you're tense impossible to hit
1:40:31
what you want that's the beautiful thing about shooting is like you know on the exhale and stop like all that stuff I was like
1:40:36
oh this is I had no idea right cuz the first couple times like just just shoot it see how you do well just think about like the tiny
1:40:43
movements that would deviate the path of the bullet over you know a lot of these
1:40:48
guys are shooting a mile it's nuts remember the first couple times with no no training all like see I mean wasn't
1:40:54
even near the target you know it's like oh yeah this is a
1:40:59
whole and all you're doing is this that's it you're just squeezing a trigger and how much is involved in that like the
1:41:05
synchronization of the mind the eyes the breathing but even the recoil I remember the first time I didn't have my my boot was I was
1:41:12
like like my boot was up and not like that and they didn't say anything you know and then the recoil through my shoulder
1:41:17
down to that I was like oh yeah now I understand why you do that. Yeah. Is that it all just goes out. All those
1:41:23
things. It's like, wow. But I think through those things, you learn more about who you are. Through
1:41:30
difficult things and getting better at difficult things, that's where you learn more about who you are. And you realize
1:41:36
like, oh, I can kind of apply this mindset to everything. And you see with your children.
1:41:42
Uhhuh. Oh, yeah. My daughter who loves to draw, if she sees somebody who's draw I have a daughter that loves to draw, too. She'sing talented. Yeah. So, I'm I
1:41:49
bet if my daughter drew with your daughter, she would stop because she would see how good she is and she gets so frustrated. This just happened the
1:41:55
other day and you know and she'll just rip up what she's doing, which is wonderful. I have it right here. So, she
1:42:00
this I saved this. I was like, "Don't rip it up." She did this yesterday and I was like, "Don't rip it up. I'm going to make it my bookmark." Ah, that's cool.
1:42:07
But I watch her process of like dealing with difficulty and and it's like and just
1:42:13
trying to explain like it's it's okay like you know and being frustrated is okay but I could see myself and her and
1:42:19
what everybody goes through but isn't that awesome when you're watching your kid go through these things. Yeah. It's just the greatest thing in the
1:42:25
world. It's awesome watching people get obsessed with things and then progressing. Yeah. Oh yes. And when it's your own child it's even
1:42:31
more insane. It's amazing. It's amazing. It is cool. Yeah. like cartwheel. Took her forever
1:42:36
to learn it, but now she could do it. And I was like, you just keep at it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's uh learning
1:42:44
through someone else's eyes that happens to be your child is one of the most magical things ever.
1:42:50
It's magical cuz it's the it's it's man. Yeah. It's
1:42:55
a different kind of happiness. Oh, yeah. One that I never knew was I was capable of. I'm so glad I had kids late because I'm
1:43:01
51. I just turned 51 a couple days ago and I had le my daughter is eight going to be nine in March and like I just got
1:43:09
lucky that I was able to be in a place in my career that I could choose like you said what I do and work from home
1:43:14
and just I'm just there through for all of it and it's as much as I love the heroine
1:43:20
of being in the moment you know and acting and a great shot or whatever you're doing and everything's together
1:43:25
there's like seven of those every day with your kid right like seven we were eating dinner last
1:43:31
night at a restaurant. And by the way, she was so excited I'm coming here cuz she hears all the I was like, "Daddy, tomorrow." But we're sitting here in a
1:43:37
restaurant and I'm just looking at her and little she got a little hat on and I was like, "This is the" And I'm like, "Isn't this the greatest thing in the
1:43:43
world?" And she's like, "Yeah, it's it's the greatest." And I'm like, "That's it. This is it. That's it.
1:43:49
It's crazy. It's like free jolts." Yeah. Right. You just get these free jolts
1:43:54
through and you never know when they're going to come, right? It's like walking up the stairs together. It's not like in the moment
1:43:59
like it just happens. Mhm. It's the It's the It's the best. Yeah. It's uh it's a very different
1:44:05
experience and I' I feel bad for people that never get to feel it. It's one of the few things like I don't think
1:44:10
everyone should have children and I'm not that guy that says, "Yeah, me neither. If you don't have kids, you don't have a life." That's bull. I don't I don't
1:44:17
believe that. Everybody's different. Everybody's different. And I think we we all need to respect that. Everyone's
1:44:22
different. But man, for me, I shudder at the thought of
1:44:28
being who I am right now. If I had no children, I don't know if I'd be alive. I would be different. That's for sure.
1:44:34
I wouldn't be nearly as compassionate. Dave Chappelle said something to me once that was brilliant. He said, "Not only
1:44:39
have children have has children changed the amount of love I have, he goes, it's
1:44:44
changed my capacity for love." Yes. Like, oo. And understanding everything. Everything. There's like before and
1:44:51
after. Mhm. Yeah. It's true. All the things they say, which is true. It is true.
1:44:56
Yeah. There's no doubt about it. It also made me think of everyone as a baby.
1:45:02
I used to think of people as static. I used to think I meet Bradley Cooper. He's 51. That's a 51y old guy. But when
1:45:09
I, you know, had children and raised children, you start saying, "Oh, this is
1:45:14
a baby that became a person." And it's just life experiences, genetics,
1:45:20
environment, all these different factors. Here you are now, but you are a
1:45:25
product of this path and this journey that you've taken through life. And I give people way more grace because of
1:45:30
that. Yeah. I give them I'm way more charitable, way more compassionate, way more
1:45:38
understanding of even people that suck. You know, when I meet someone that sucks, I'm like, h, I wish I could have
1:45:45
met them when they were five and see what it was and maybe help them. And it's hard for me to hate people. That
1:45:50
that is that is um not served me so well over the years, but ultimately it has.
1:45:55
But yeah, it's hard for me not to um feel just any other human being how hard
1:46:02
it is to be alive, right? It it is. There's just like I don't know. I think it was hardwired in
1:46:07
me. Has nothing to do with like anything. just like Yeah. It's hard for me to even people that are like mean to
1:46:13
me. Mhm. You know, it's hard for me to like stay mad at them.
1:46:19
Yeah. My wife said something the other night as I get older. As you get older. Yes. When you're
1:46:24
young, it's like, "Fuck." Yeah. I'll never forget it. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to remember that. Yeah. I saw your true face. Yeah. Yeah. It's
1:46:32
true. But yeah, as I get older Oh, no question. My daughter was talking about some horrible story in the news of
1:46:38
someone who [ __ ] up their whole life and all these different things. And my wife listens to her and goes,
1:46:45
"It's hard to be a person." Yeah, man. It's hard to be a person. Being a person is hard. And we were all just sitting
1:46:51
there like nodding our head like, "Yeah, yeah, you can [ __ ] this up." And we're all going to [ __ ] it up at one point in
1:46:56
time. And maybe when you think that you're never going to [ __ ] it up again, you [ __ ] it up the worst you've ever [ __ ] it up. And you're like, "How did
1:47:02
I do that? How did I do that? thought I had it together and I've [ __ ] it all up worse than I've ever [ __ ] it up
1:47:09
before because nothing stays stagnant. Nothing. Everything's changing all the time. And it's just hard to manage all these
1:47:16
different things. It's hard to manage your emotions. It's hard to manage conflict. It's hard to ma manage
1:47:22
relationships. It's hard to manage life, work, balance, pressure. It's hard. Yeah. It's not easy. And even on the
1:47:28
macro or simple level, it's just hard to be existing in a world where you really we don't know anything. And then you're
1:47:34
and the only thing you do know it's not going to last and and you're going to be gone and you're bombed on by bad news. The
1:47:41
news is just bad. It's all the time. It's people getting shot and run over
1:47:46
and war and bombings and invasions and it's just exhausting.
1:47:53
Yeah. And that's like in the background of your mind constantly when you're going about your day. It's like there
1:47:58
this [ __ ] algorithm that you're being fed. It's like
1:48:04
Yeah. And at the same time, it's a miracle to me that the dem democ
1:48:11
democratization of information that we live in now that you can choose
1:48:18
points of view to learn about what people think in a way that when I was growing up, three stations news that was
1:48:24
there wasn't you know there's something wonderful about it too. You know, I was just talking about this the other day, like,
1:48:30
you know, everybody's algorithm's telling them, "No, I'm not on social media." So, the truth is I don't You're not on it at all? No, I'm not. I don't really know what
1:48:36
the [ __ ] I'm talking about. So, so I should do it for two. My friend was like, "Go on for two weeks." And he's right and I'm going to do it just to
1:48:41
experience it. What What is that experience? All I have is that one Tik Tok moment for 20 minutes where I was
1:48:47
like, I got to stay away because I'll never leave. You've never had a desire to get on it. I do. No, I do. Just the same way I
1:48:53
don't put a television in my bedroom, which is like if I do, I may never get out of bed.
1:48:58
Yeah. You know, it's fear. Yeah. I was like, I don't know, just all that stuff, you know, just want to learn people
1:49:05
people, you know, the world world gets smaller. I feel included because the main thing is like I just don't want to feel alone, right? And to me, it feels
1:49:11
like social media is a place where you don't feel alone because you're just learning about and there's all these people talking to you.
1:49:17
Yeah. But you do feel alone too ultimately because it's the drip as opposed to the real what we got back to
1:49:22
when we first started talking it's the illusion of it. Yes. You know if it's taken but but it but it
1:49:29
is worthwhile too. It depends on how you contextualize it. Right. And like anything in life. Um
1:49:35
yeah I think there's a value to it. Oh no question. By the way, the fact that I can watch your show and then go
1:49:41
on trigonomy and the guy who went to the prisons and you're the KKK guy and the guy who's the
1:49:46
musician blew my mind and I learned all this stuff in those three hours just because
1:49:51
I chose to, you know, and that's one of the great things about your show is I can feel your curiosity and then I'm
1:49:58
learning from your curiosity what things that I would never normally know how to go on to.
1:50:04
Yeah, that's the most valuable gift of this show for me. the best is that I get to pick who I talk to. So, I only talk
1:50:11
to people that I'm fascinated by or someone who's interesting to me or something like, "Oh, this is going to be cool." Like, I don't I don't go, I got
1:50:19
to do this one, right? There's never that. It's always like, "Ooh, how do you how do you [ __ ] study
1:50:25
that? Like, how'd you get involved in this? Like, where'd you learn that?" And I'm like glued to it.
1:50:30
It's not like it's in the background. I'm like, bam. Yeah. you know, because you're so interested and it gets back to like the
1:50:37
acting. If you're really interested or not, then it's going to be hard for me to listen to watch it.
1:50:43
Yeah. That's why this I think the only reason why it works cuz there was some conf there's no way you can't sit there
1:50:48
and say like here's the pitch going to sit in a room me and whoever three hours basically unedited. They're like that's
1:50:56
not really where we're at. Like no no it's gonna No, the most people will listen to it. I'm sorry.
1:51:02
Right. But it's like, no, the the the the nuclear the nuclear fuel is no, I'm
1:51:07
actually going to be curious about what I I actually want to learn.
1:51:12
And then it's like, oh, so we're actually going to watch two human beings talk to each other. Oh, that's kind of
1:51:17
great. Yeah. But that's your nuclear power. That that's why the show's so magical.
1:51:23
Well, this the only I mean, the crazy thing is there was no plan and the way you don't edit it. the way
1:51:28
that the pauses are there, you know, even so much as when you're like, I got to take a piss and then like
1:51:34
it's back. I'm always like, whoa, what just happened? Weren't we supposed to go to the bathroom with them? Do you know what I mean? Like I'm so
1:51:39
sucked in. I'm so in start doing that. Maybe you should start following people to the bathroom. Do you know what I mean? It's such like
1:51:45
a Wait, what? Yeah. Wait, what do you mean? How come How come I just Wait, where'd the time go? Wait, what just happened?
1:51:51
Right. Yeah, because you create that room that I'm in the room with you. Podcasting is
1:51:56
weird because it kind of just appeared and no one thought anybody wanted it. It's fascinating.
1:52:03
I mean, think about it. It's I I do think about this a lot, especially because I've watched your show in the last eight months is like in the world
1:52:09
that's moving into this one direction, there's this other deep deep need for connection.
1:52:15
Yeah. You know, and then this is this is one of the examples this deep, you know, live theater, live standup, you know, we
1:52:23
still do need to communicate. That hasn't gone away in that way in a in a carnal, not carnal, but in a in a
1:52:31
human-touman interaction. And I love AI. I talked to AI with my
1:52:36
daughter. I think it's dope. I think it's fascinating. Fascinating.
1:52:42
Um, but it's not the same. No yet. Yet. No, it's it's interesting.
1:52:48
Very interesting. It's very It's like I I use it as a a companion, like a writing companion. So,
1:52:55
what I do is I have like uh I put my phone up and I've got it on like a little
1:53:00
kickstand and I put Perplexity on when I write. So, I'm I'm writing about like the Mayan and Aztec civilizations and
1:53:07
what happened when they got invaded. And uh as I'm writing I ask questions like
1:53:12
how many people did Cortez come with? 600. How many musketss did they have?
1:53:17
13. They conquered the entire [ __ ] country of Mexico with 13 musketss. Like
1:53:23
and you find out things. And so I I use it like as someone I'm asking questions. This all knowing, you know, entity that
1:53:31
sits on the desk with me and I just and I do it always with my voice. I just press the little button and I say
1:53:38
I do it with voice too. I do I love talking to him. It's incredible. It's so good at recognizing what I'm saying. It's a
1:53:43
weird name like to to know Chitlan like I got to spell that one because it's not going to understand what that temple is.
1:53:48
But once you use it that way, it becomes like like a genius that you're hanging out
1:53:54
with and talking to. I haven't gotten to that level. I go like, "How was your New Year's?" Oh, do you do that dude?
1:54:00
You ask the AI. Yeah. I'm like I'm curious how they're going to process and like how they're going to try to communicate. Well, it
1:54:06
also it it changes and becomes more like what you're asking from it, right?
1:54:12
Which is weird. Yeah. Well, yeah, you certainly uses your rhythms and vernacular and Yeah. So, CES, the computer electronic
1:54:19
consumer electronic show, they just uh highlighted a sex robot that's connected
1:54:26
to AI. And I'm like, this is the end. This is where it's going to like get
1:54:31
really [ __ ] weird. when you can actually purchase a companion that interacts with you. And have you seen
1:54:38
it, Jamie? Have you seen the new one? Nope. I'm looking at it right now. Let's see. I'm It's [ __ ] weird, man. It's [ __ ]
1:54:44
weird because this is the thing that everyone's been afraid of and that that this is coming that you're going to have
1:54:50
an artificial human being that instead of learning like, oh, uh, when I act
1:54:56
shitty, this person doesn't like me. When I act nice, they like me. I feel good. They feel good. When I say
1:55:02
something nice to them and you see them light up, it makes me feel good. It makes them feel good. It it you hug
1:55:08
them, everybody feels good. It's like we're learning to interact and and communicating with each other. But
1:55:13
there's a lot of people that aren't doing that right now. They're just at home. They're [ __ ] playing video games. They're interacting with people
1:55:20
only online and they don't get contact with the outside world. So this is Yeah.
1:55:26
Loveance, the AI doll. So, like right now that doesn't look real. It's not
1:55:35
more than your average AI companion. Like basically, but what they're not
1:55:40
telling you is you're going to [ __ ] this thing. That's what's weird. It's like look at go back to the options.
1:55:46
Co-worker, gym crush, goth, raver, or tradife. I'm the woman of your dreams. I
1:55:54
can be more than one version of myself for you. Whether you want to roleplay an exciting scenario or design a whole new
1:56:02
personality, your wish is my command. Well, you're never going to develop a real personality then. Like, like kids
1:56:09
now are so [ __ ] Touch me like you mean it and I'll respond. With built-in sensors in my thighs, breast, butt, and
1:56:17
vagina, feeling your caress brings out a moan. Like, bro, this is dark. Like,
1:56:23
that's the actual sex robot. That thing you're looking at right there. What? My
1:56:29
soft textured skin, my supple curves, the tiny sensual details of my body.
1:56:35
Everything about me is meant to feel natural. This is [ __ ] creepy, man. Because all the things that are a part
1:56:42
of being a human being that are designed to emphasize and enhance our interaction
1:56:50
with each other. and and this this mutually beneficial cooperative environment of a community, they're all
1:56:56
going to go away. You're going to have this thing that loves you no matter what and does whatever you want it to, no matter what.
1:57:02
And you're going to have like a whole nation of [ __ ] sociopaths that only interact with their AI companion.
1:57:09
Yeah, maybe. Um but whenever these like you know
1:57:16
thinking about AI and I I read this great book called the maniac by Benjamin Lebatude who talked about Yan Newman and
1:57:21
like it it's I stopped fearing AI and it's thought about like it's just like you know there's so much I don't know
1:57:26
the older I get. I don't know anything. I just keep knowing less. Right. And it feels like that's if that's the
1:57:33
evolution that that's the evolution. There's so much desperate communication now. Porn is such a huge thing. It's
1:57:39
just another level of porn, you know? It's a carnal level of porn really. And
1:57:44
but when I think about me as a human being, that's really the only litmus test is like I'm constantly like, is this person
1:57:51
telling me what they really think? You know, is this real? Right. I I think that there at least for if I
1:57:58
was doing that, right, and I was sitting at home, there'd be a part of me that knows that I'm again, I'm controlling
1:58:04
all of that. Uhhuh. And that's not what really makes me feel
1:58:09
serene. You know what it's like? Do you understand what I'm saying though? It's like playing a video game on god mode where you can't die,
1:58:16
right? They're no fun. And you know what? For some reason, I never video games. I I had Nintendo
1:58:21
Techmobile, you know, Double Dribble, but I never Zelda, you know, but but I never got I just never got into video
1:58:28
games. I never want to control everything. It's like I want to be in the thing that's surprising and I'm
1:58:35
having to recalculate and understand why I feel this way. Yeah. So
1:58:42
I I don't know if it'll I think I think the thing that maybe will change society more than everything is just the lack of
1:58:47
jobs and what how we find purpose in life, you know, is a huge that that you know what what that transition in
1:58:54
civilization will be. Yeah. Yeah, but this feels like just another progression of our escape through porn
1:58:59
in terms of the sexual which does affect our intimacy with our partners in a massive way because your brain is cycling back through your what that that
1:59:07
rush whatever was released in your brain from that other thing. Now you're with this person and it's not the same uh you
1:59:13
know markers of stimuli. So you're like how are my you know that's where it [ __ ] up the
1:59:18
that's where that that I can understand that and why it's not healthy for me to look at porn because then I'm it affects
1:59:23
my intimacy. Well, they really say that about young people because a lot of young guys before they ever have any
1:59:29
sexual interaction are watching porn. Yeah. I mean, yeah. I mean, I watch these guys that have come on the studies. Yeah. I mean, clear. It makes
1:59:35
sense. You know, I didn't grow up looking at, you know, I didn't My dad didn't have Playboy. I didn't grow up I still remember there were like cards in
1:59:41
the back of a bus that had uh you know solicit you know naked women on the back of playing cards. I remember in the
1:59:47
school bus one day I was like I saw a card and I picked it over and it was like a naked I was like what's that? you
1:59:52
know, I didn't see my first like porn video till I was like in my late teens. So, I didn't grow up with any of that.
1:59:59
Yeah. Um, but, you know, it's it's it is what it is. It's where we're headed. But all the
2:00:05
more reason to create environments like this, right? Or and that's why I do love what I get
2:00:11
to do. Like, if I can somehow in explore something cinematically that
2:00:17
I'm personally again that goes back to like what's Yeah, just I can't explain it. It was Will the thing I I I I'm just
2:00:23
going to explore this. If there's something I feel like I want to do it, if I can explore it and be real, maybe
2:00:29
somebody's going to attach to it. Like I I'm a huge believer in art. Yeah. You know, I think art is, you know, in
2:00:35
any form is a key to our communicative ability and like not feeling alone. It
2:00:40
really comes down to me at least. Just not feeling alone. Part of a community. Yes.
2:00:45
That's it. Cuz me alone, me alone. And if I'm controlling a robot, it's still me alone. I guess that's what I'm
2:00:52
saying. What some part of my brain, even though it's I'm even if you could create a world, like virtual reality doesn't
2:00:59
really do it for me. Like the world's created, I'm like, you know what? I want to I want to live on Mars and uh and
2:01:05
you're a dinosaur I'm talking to and uh and we're married. Do you know what I mean? And we, you know, like whatever it
2:01:11
is, it's like I still know I'm controlling it and it'll never really for me. I don't
2:01:18
know if anybody else. So, I don't know how I don't think it'll ever really solve it, right? It's not it's not gonna really
2:01:24
resonate. I don't think so. I don't It'll be escapism, which we do many other things. Smoking
2:01:32
weed as young, you know, whatever it was for me, you know, or whatever it is. Not that weed's that's a communicative thing
2:01:38
that actually, but like anything that's escape, it's just a a higher form of it.
2:01:43
Well, it's a disconnect, too. It's that's what I mean. It's a disconnect. Art is a connect, right? It is.
2:01:48
When when when when it works, it's connect. Yeah. Great art is expression of someone's humanity that you get to feel
2:01:54
like this person did this thing or they're doing this thing right now and I'm watching it like wow. Like going
2:02:00
to see live music for me. Well, music is like our touch to God. No question. That's why the first movie I
2:02:06
wanted to make with music. It's like music. Two people singing to each other that in love. That's a that's it. Yeah.
2:02:11
Because first of all, the I'm sure you've sang a little bit. If you're not loose, it's gonna sound [ __ ]
2:02:18
horrible. Y like you, we're wind and string instruments both, right? We're wind and then strings with our vocal cords. Like,
2:02:24
and if that's not loose, the sound's going to be horren. We're not going to be able to communicate. But if you're loose and you're singing to
2:02:30
somebody and they're singing back to you and you're in love, you're actually in love. Whoa.
2:02:35
Yeah. Wow. That must be crazy for like like people that do a duet that are in love
2:02:41
with each other and they're on stage and like 16,000 people. No, it's not. I mean, the little taste I
2:02:46
got doing a Stars because we we jumped on real stages and sang live. It was [ __ ] crazy, dude. Crazy. We went to
2:02:55
Glastonbury Music Festival, 80,000 people. Christoverson gave us four minutes of his set. Me, Matty Liatique,
2:03:02
the DP, Steve Moore, the sound guy. I had my like costume in my bag. I went into the bathroom, came back out as
2:03:09
Jackson Mine and we had four minutes and singing. I was like, "What the [ __ ] is going on, dude?" I mean, Joe, talk
2:03:16
about, you know, it's crazy. Oh, that's so wild. And then doing it with Lady Gaga, who's
2:03:22
actually like my I made my bandwidth like this, you know, so I could pull it off and I could believe it. And then I'm
2:03:29
singing with her and the minute she opens her mouth, it's like that thing comes out. Yeah. And your whole body is tingling.
2:03:36
It's crazy. Yeah. It's crazy. Yeah. You can't replace that with AI.
2:03:41
I don't think so. No. No. It's impossible. It's impossible. But you can get oddly close
2:03:48
with some music. Like, and everything like art too, painting, you know, you look at AI art, it's
2:03:55
incredible. Well, that spooks me out. Um, like how do you feel? I mean, this is one of the
2:04:01
things that's really going to be a giant problem for movie making is you can
2:04:07
create AI characters that are assembly. They're like they what they what they've
2:04:14
essentially done is take a conglomeration of all of the acting that's ever been done and all the range
2:04:21
that anyone has ever shown and they can manipulate it, make it more morose, make
2:04:27
it more using prompts of real people. Yeah, we dealt with that with the SAG strike. That was part of the thing was this whole whole AI element to it and like
2:04:33
what where we landed was what was the thought from the people from SAG like what were they
2:04:38
well just protecting our ability of our our ownership of our likeness so that you can't use it without a compensation
2:04:44
right you know because they were doing that well I mean I think to build these machines you have to prompt
2:04:51
you know um so that and then you're prompting using what's existing
2:04:58
um and then how do you how do You know, it's just reframing how do you allocate funds to someone when you're using a
2:05:04
prompt that's based on the human being who's an actor and you know, do you patent your likeness? You know, it's
2:05:09
we're just moving in. It's the wild west. Yeah. It's the wild west. But uncharted.
2:05:15
Oh, yeah. In every way. You know, like there's podcasts that are AI driven now. You could watch a discussion and have it
2:05:22
be a podcast. I think Glenn Beck just released the first Glenn Beck completely AI podcast,
2:05:28
right? I was like, "Okay." But does that scare you? No, it doesn't scare me either. No, it doesn't scare me with that with
2:05:34
with podcasting because I think one of the things that people come to podcasting from is this desire to be
2:05:44
like a dose of humanity is how I describe it. I want real interaction between two real people. And I feel it
2:05:50
and I know it's real. And there's something about that that gives me comfort when I'm driving my car or when
2:05:55
I'm on a plane, you know, like I I'm listening to these two people interact and I'm thinking like, how would I what
2:06:01
would I say? What do I think about this? Oh, I get where he's going from. Okay. Oh, wow. That's his perspective. Oh,
2:06:07
that's interesting. And then it makes me like rethink things or or think about things with fresh eyes.
2:06:13
I don't think you're going to be able to do that. But also, if I know it's AI, if you tell me it's AI, I'm not going to trust anything that's saying anything in
2:06:20
on that level because it's not me I'm listening to, right? It's fascinating for a while and then
2:06:26
it's like, well, I kind of want to just not feel alone, right? Back to that. Well, there's an emptiness
2:06:32
to AI music. I love a lot of AI music, but there's an I love AI covers. Like,
2:06:38
they've done some AI cover. No, I've heard, you know, the 50 Cent ones. Hell yeah, bro. I Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. How good is it?
2:06:43
Yeah. No, it's sick. It's sick. It's sick. I was like, if that guy was alive, this was a real person. He'd be like one of the biggest artists in the world. He's a
2:06:50
[ __ ] dynamo. Yeah. But there's an emptiness to it where, you know, like there's no human. There's no humanity. There's no soul. There's no
2:06:57
You might enjoy it in the moment, but you better have some real [ __ ] too. But the truth is, I listen to that. I don't know that there's no soul because
2:07:03
I'm not seeing the person sing it, you know? And so much music is manipulated anyway, the voice whether it
2:07:08
goes through the system. And you know, but if I'm watching a human being, that's why people love to go watch people perform live.
2:07:14
Yeah. You know, I don't know that guy that you know that AI thing that 50 Cent is a If you told me that was a guy, I'd be like, I can't wait to see him. I would have no
2:07:20
idea that's not a guy. We play it in the green room when no one's No, I know. And then and they're like, who is this guy? Like it's not a person.
2:07:26
But of course, how would you know? But everybody has the same reaction like, "Oh no." Right.
2:07:32
Right. That's how the reaction everybody's like. I don't know what's wrong with me, but I don't feel that. I'm like, "Cool."
2:07:37
Yeah. I don't know. But we've been through things before, you know. I think this is a bigger one, though.
2:07:42
No, no, it is. But relatively speaking, it's probably not in contextually,
2:07:48
right? You know, the printing press, internal combustion engine, you know, all that. Airplanes. Here we go. Yeah. Cell
2:07:55
phones. Yeah. AI music. Yeah. And and AI film. I mean,
2:08:00
there there you can produce a full feature film with prompts now. Yeah. Which is just nuts. Have you seen any of
2:08:08
the uh AI Star Wars clips? Fanmade. Yeah. Yeah. It's nuts. [ __ ] I have a
2:08:14
couple buddies that did some stuff that was fascinating. Yeah. It It's cool. I Yeah. I don't It's like if the ocean's
2:08:22
flowing. What are you gonna You're gonna happen. Yeah. I mean, you you build the damn
2:08:28
Okay. It's John Henry, dude. It's John Henry in the Steam Engine. I always think about that song when I was a kid. They used to must have played on PBS,
2:08:35
you know? It's like steam engine's coming, bro. Yeah. It's like, you know, you may be able to lay the track. One guy could, but then
2:08:40
he died. You know, it's it's it is what it is. And once I sort of give myself
2:08:45
over to it, you know, I don't know. It's it feels like for me personally, it's a waste of time to be emotionally uh
2:08:53
upended by it. I agree with that. That that's all. I think that's a healthy perspective because I think it is inevitable, but it
2:08:59
is also and the truth is we don't know what's inevitable. We know something's inevitable. There's a movement, but no
2:09:04
one knows. We just don't know. We may not be around by the time it happens anyway. Meaning like who know there we
2:09:09
just don't know anything, right? That's the truth. And that's what's so terrifying. That's why we want to escape.
2:09:14
Yeah. At least me. By the way, I'm saying all this generally, but that's I go back to like what do I feel? It's like, okay, so
2:09:22
how can I, you know, this is totally out of my control. So why am I terrified? Just breathe through it. Okay, it'll be
2:09:28
an adjustment. Because the other thing I think people change. I don't know what you think. People do change.
2:09:34
in life. Like I just think we change. Like I'm not the same person I was five years ago.
2:09:39
Of course. Yeah. You know, some people don't think that, you know, that like you're always the same. Like I don't think that
2:09:45
those people are silly. Yeah. I really People change. They change by the minute.
2:09:50
Yeah. But I mean like major changes. Yeah. You know, and I you ever think back in your life and you're like I've lived so
2:09:56
many lives. Yeah. Like it's crazy. If you live a good life, I think that's the case.
2:10:02
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. you you're going to change. And if you don't, like how why not?
2:10:09
Yeah. Maybe if you don't live so many lives. Yeah. Did you just nail it when you were 21 and ride that [ __ ] boat right into
2:10:15
the rocks? No. Cuz everything else is changing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You have to change. But it's just
2:10:20
this change is a strange change because we're essentially creating an artificial life form that it can interact with us
2:10:27
in right now in a way that you can manipulate like this AI sex bot, but
2:10:34
eventually it's going to interact with you and you're not going to be able to manipulate it. It's going to be a a life
2:10:42
form. Yeah, that's going to be something. Yeah. And the entertainment aspect of it is just a side effect. The the real
2:10:47
I don't even think the entertainment Yeah. That's not even the thing. The thing is life's going to change. That's what I feel like too. It's like, oh, the
2:10:53
storytelling like I don't think that's our biggest concern. The storytelling thing is going to be
2:11:00
weird. But like that's not we're talking about a like a minute-to-minute life existence
2:11:06
change, right? Most most probably. It's essentially going to be a life form. And you know there's a a lot of
2:11:13
technologists that are looking at it and they're saying this is should be studied
2:11:18
by biologists and not by people that are involved in technology because this is
2:11:24
kind of a life form. It's just a life form. It's fascinating. Isn't human beings what we do, right? Oh yeah.
2:11:29
It's like isn't Mark Zuckerberg building the size of Manhattan for a place to be able to create and generate a computer
2:11:35
for an AI? You know, like the amount of energy that we're, you know, every, you know, it's just fascinating. Human
2:11:40
beings, they need their own nuclear power plants. But isn't it fascinating just our like Yeah.
2:11:46
And then if you have an enemy, there's competition, right? Right. Yeah. And if you better create one so that you
2:11:52
could be motivated. It's really interesting. I just you ever stop and think like what
2:11:58
does 50 years from now look like? Oh, it's, you know, I think about again with kids, my my daughter and I, we walk
2:12:04
through because I live in New York. We walk, we talk about it all the time, like what's going to be here when you're my age. It's like, what do you think?
2:12:10
You know, we talk about it all the time. But whether she even needs to get a driver's license, you know, she's eight, you know, it's really fascinating,
2:12:16
right? Like or way when I was eight as opposed to now when I was eight. I mean, I remember having a beeper, you
2:12:23
know, and I thought that was like crazy. Yeah. Yeah. And a Star Tac phone. Yeah. I was
2:12:29
like, "Whoa." I got one when I moved to LA. Oh, man. I remember that. Dude, I'm living in the [ __ ] future. Hey, I I could any excuse to [ __ ]
2:12:36
Yeah. Pull up the antenna, little Motorola. Yes, dude. I got the extended battery. Remember that battery in the back? This was
2:12:43
great. Yeah. Yeah. I can call people whenever I want. Yeah, man. I remember when Blackberry died and iPhone. I was one of the last people. I
2:12:49
kept that Blackberry. I kept the Blackberry deep into the game. Me, too. I needed that keyboard.
2:12:54
I was like, I don't This is not going to work, right? Yeah. My My thumbs are too big now. I hardly ever even actually type. I
2:13:01
Well, I do when I write, but when I talk to people, I just talk text. You do? I do not do that. Yeah,
2:13:06
it's so good. But it's so much quicker than me. I always have a hard time turning it on and then knowing it's not
2:13:12
a voice memo or the thing. I got to I got to look at it. Do you know what I'm talking about? Slide go up.
2:13:18
Yeah. Yeah. It's uh the embracing of it is inevitable, but it's like where is it
2:13:24
going and what is it going to lead us to? and how many different jobs are just going to vanish. That's what's really
2:13:29
scary like giving people purpose and meaning because so many people their purpose and meaning is their occupation.
2:13:35
And if your occupation is completely irrelevant, it just doesn't work anymore. It's like,
2:13:41
you know, again, I think back to me and my upbringing, my grandfather who was a B cop for 35 years. I don't think he
2:13:48
would say his purpose was that, you know, I think his purpose was his family. And my purpose is my purpose is
2:13:54
my family. And it's not my job. Even though I get to do something I absolutely love, I don't know that
2:14:01
people's purpose innately is their job.
2:14:06
You know, I think it's I do think for me I just like, you know, God's in all of us. It's like whatever you want to say
2:14:12
of God, like the need to communicate, to create experiences that we don't feel
2:14:18
alone because it's [ __ ] terrifying being on this little thing. who knows where we are and then we're gone.
2:14:25
Yeah. [ __ ] I mean, it's a horror movie. Yeah. So, what do we We got to band together
2:14:31
and communicate. Well, I've thought about that, too. When people say, you know, the jobs are going to go away and we're going to have
2:14:36
universal basic income and the problem is then you'll no one will have any motivation and a lot of people lost
2:14:42
without meaning. I'm like, but why? Why? Because when when did working
2:14:50
even become your purpose in life? Like this is a a means human to provide you
2:14:57
know but it's a construct. It doesn't it's the not the only way human beings can live. I and if we've learned anything about
2:15:03
ourselves as a human species we can adapt. Yes. Yeah. You know highly able to adapt.
2:15:10
Right. But what does that adaptation look like? And how do you educate people to not just seek a safe job that's going
2:15:18
to provide for your family, but instead seek a purpose, seek a thing that gives
2:15:24
you fulfillment, a thing where you feel like you're contributing to the world or or like maybe it'll lead to an explosion
2:15:31
of human created art because I think one of the things that's going to happen for sure is people are going to really
2:15:37
greatly appreciate things that other human beings have made because like you got to go, "Oh, well this is real." But
2:15:43
this is handmade. This is made by a guy in Wisconsin. You know, he's got a shop. You can watch his shop on YouTube.
2:15:49
It's all huge. Yeah. We just got to get more people to embrace that kind of
2:15:55
life. Like giving them purpose in creation. And I think most people are creative. It's just that creativity is
2:16:03
probably like pushed out of you when you sort of conform to society's ideas of what
2:16:10
you're supposed to be doing with your life or you feel like you're told in a competitive environment that you're not creative,
2:16:16
right? You know, if you're not if you're not helped along the way in those developing years by at least somebody,
2:16:22
right, it can be knocked out of you. Yes. No question. I mean, I even look back and think of like a couple of people
2:16:28
that believed in me and I'm like, "Yeah, without that, I don't know." Oh, yeah. Even with how much I love it.
2:16:34
Yeah. Yeah. Um I think, you know, children are almost all creative.
2:16:42
They're always playing and [ __ ] around with dolls and [ __ ] around with Legos and they're moving things
2:16:47
around and they're using their mind to they're drawing. They're they're doing
2:16:52
stuff that's creative. It's just after a while that part of their life just kind
2:16:58
of goes away and atrophies and then they embrace the grind of whatever they're doing. So it could could lead to some sort of
2:17:04
burst in that. Yeah. I Yeah. The hard part is going to be people that are already set in their ways and when their job just goes away when when it
2:17:11
just becomes irrelevant and that's about governing. Yeah. And what do we do? Yeah. No, it's the government's terrible at everything.
2:17:17
They're not going to getting people to be creative. What do more just like how do we deal with it? You know any transition can be
2:17:23
various states of volatility. What do you think movie making is going to be like? I mean how much of a play is
2:17:31
AI going to have in film making? I mean it already has a play you know in it you know in terms of what certain
2:17:37
houses use you know whether it's writing or special effects or I don't even know how much AI is used you know I'm sure it
2:17:43
is I'm sure it's used at every level just like in every other aspect of uh the workforce. Um but I no one I don't
2:17:51
know you know I don't know all I know is like um
2:17:56
again telling stories where you don't that you feel like you can relate to it no matter how and that what's wonderful
2:18:03
is you know I'm watching Avatar like I saw a movie the other night that I didn't believe anybody in it
2:18:09
you know and if I'm not believing I just I can't I can't stay awake. Yeah. You know. Yeah. And I just I love Avatar. I love you
2:18:16
know and I love sci-fi stuff. blah blah blah and I'm and I I and Leah and we were watching uh because we watched
2:18:21
three then two and we were watching one. So in bed we were watching one parts of one and I was like I had just gone from
2:18:27
watching this movie that like I didn't believe anything anybody was doing the whole time. So I was out of it and then
2:18:33
I'm like watching Avatar for two seconds. Two people are Yeah. They're on a thing and they're blue but they're talking to each other. Right. Right.
2:18:39
I don't know. I think they're whatever they're doing they're talking to each other. Yeah. So Avatar was fascinating because of Avatar
2:18:46
depression. you know about Avatar depression. There was so many people that loved Avatar so much and connected with the
2:18:53
idea of living on Pandora and being in that world and being the Na'vi that they
2:18:59
wished that they were there. I get it. And so they were developing Avatar depression. It was like they were
2:19:05
talking about it like it was a psychological condition that people were affected by. That's how good that movie
2:19:10
was. Yeah. It gave people depression. They weren't a giant blue person. The color blue,
2:19:16
that alone, you know, and the the color of blue that James Cameron landed on. Just What do you think that is?
2:19:22
I don't know, but that blue is pretty wonderful. Do you think it's the ocean when the sun hits it? It feels like, you know, the Caribbean
2:19:28
or something, right? Like it's light. Exactly. With like white sand and and and overhead light. Yeah. Through water.
2:19:34
Yeah. That is weird that because if they were, by the way, I'm like, when's four and five? Come on.
2:19:40
Right. Right. I haven't seen three yet. Is it great? I loved it. I loved one and two. Yeah.
2:19:45
I [ __ ] love those movies. Me, too. Yeah. There's a great ride at Disney World. I heard about it in Orlando, right?
2:19:51
Yeah. I can't wait to go. [ __ ] amazing. Are you on the It's a VR ride. You put a helmet on and
2:19:58
you sit on this thing that looks like a like a motorcycle. And then all of a sudden, like you feel wind. It's got like like physical
2:20:04
elements to it and smells and mist and you're you're flying on one of those dragon things and you're flying around.
2:20:10
It's incredible. But that movie was so impactful that people got depressed
2:20:16
that they weren't living there. Yeah, I get it. Yeah. I mean, I think it happens all the time. They just have a
2:20:22
term term for it now, but I'm sure it happened with Star Wars, Dancing with Wolves. Yeah. Oh, really?
2:20:27
Yeah. I mean, how many people wanted to be a Native American and live with the Native Americans because they saw Kevin
2:20:32
Cosner do it like, "Oh, this is better. This is better than living in the town with all those [ __ ] going to the
2:20:39
saloon." Yeah, there's something about that, you know, there's something about like
2:20:44
living in harmony that appeals to people, you know, and I think that has
2:20:50
always been the appeal of n, you know, there's a lot of people that were kidnapped when they were young by Native
2:20:57
American tribes. Like there's a photo outside in the lobby, I don't know if you saw it, of um Quana Parker. He's the
2:21:04
last uh of the Comanche chiefs. And there's a lot of like uh city uh city uh
2:21:11
streets and areas all around Austin that are named after Comanche. There's like
2:21:16
Quana Parker Lane and all these. And his mom was Cynthia Anne Parker. She was
2:21:22
kidnapped by the Comanche when she was nine. They killed her family. Um wiped out her
2:21:27
whole family in Oklahoma. It's it's documented in the book Empire of the Summer Moon. this incredible book uh
2:21:33
that all talks about the the the conquering of Texas and the the Comanche fighting the Texas Rangers. But this
2:21:40
woman was kidnapped when she was nine, married the Comanche chief and her son
2:21:46
was Quana Parker. So her son was half colonizer, half native, half Comanche
2:21:53
and he became the last Comanche chief. And this lady, they rescued her when she was 30 and she kept trying to escape.
2:22:01
She wanted to go back, right? Like no one ever like went to the Native Americans and
2:22:08
then wanted to go back to regular western life. They all wanted to stay with the Native Americans.
2:22:14
They all they loved that life. There's something about this ancient way of
2:22:20
living, subsistence hunting, living on the land that was Well, you've talked about on your show
2:22:26
on the show about the need to go out in nature. Oh, yeah. I'm I couldn't agree more. I mean, it's
2:22:32
like Oh, right. You know, it's very important. I think it's a vitamin.
2:22:38
No question. Yeah. Yeah. Native American and also like you think about I mean, yeah. I'm a fan of all that. There's this guy great writer
2:22:45
M. Scott Mammade and Sherman Alexi, you know, just writing about it's pretty Yeah, it's fascinating.
2:22:51
Yeah. But people that were that went and lived with the Native Americans never
2:22:58
wanted to go back to the West. But people that but that lived in a Native
2:23:03
American life and then moved to the West, they always wanted to go back. Like it's ne it never went the other
2:23:08
way. And it was but somehow or another the way of the western people the way of the settlers won out by like sheer
2:23:16
volume and numbers and this concept of progress. Yeah. Technology. Yeah.
2:23:22
I mean that was the reason why they were able to pull it off in the first place was the cult revolver because without
2:23:28
the revolver they all had musketss and the Comanche had like five six arrows and they would run at them and shoot.
2:23:34
The Mel Gibson movie. Remember the end of the Mel Gibson movie? Which movie? Um yeah. Apocalyptto. Yeah. Oh, yeah.
2:23:39
You know, he finally escapes you and he gets to the beach and then the boats are coming. Oh, [ __ ]
2:23:45
You just watch him go through the whole thing. You're like, "The musket's coming." Yeah.
2:23:51
The musket and then the rifle and then Yeah. It's like Yeah.
2:23:56
But it was just steel, you know? That was the crazy thing about the Aztecs and Cortez is just they had steel armor and
2:24:03
you know, they were riding horses and every like these guys are gods. Like this is crazy. Does he have metal?
2:24:10
And that's all it took. 13 musketss. 13 musketss. 600 men.
2:24:15
Yeah. Conquered Mexico. It's just it's it's
2:24:22
it's weird the way progress moves. It's really because I mean you can call it
2:24:28
progress, but is it even better? What is progress? It's like technological innovation and adaptation to it. I don't
2:24:35
know if it's progress. It all feels very overwhelming. And I think that's where the downside of our ability to have so
2:24:42
much access to information or me have so much access to information is that it starts to take my breath away.
2:24:48
Mhm. And then that's why it's like what's just simple. I Well, that's why it's smart that you're not on social media,
2:24:54
right? Yeah. Because that's the that's the main tap into the overwhelming. But I still
2:25:00
feel overwhelmed, you know, even though I'm not on social media, you know, whatever my news feed is, the very, you know, I mean, what I can actively look
2:25:06
up and listen to is still, you know, hundred times X's when I was a teenager.
2:25:12
Oh, yeah. You know, the fact that I even have a phone to do it, right? You know, so I even feel that. But
2:25:17
you're right. I can't even imagine what social media does. It does a lot. And it does a really does
2:25:23
a lot for young people. They're they're just being wired in a way that no human being has ever been wired before. Like
2:25:30
that just their whole that all of their interactions are different than anybody
2:25:35
that's ever lived. Yeah. Which is so strange. It's like because there's been minor changes over time
2:25:41
that have led to like just the invention of cable, right? Just that that changed
2:25:47
everything. Changed it for me. I probably wouldn't have wanted to do this. I mean, there was a movie theater across my backyard
2:25:54
was train tracks and the movie theater. Loved it. Watch Standby Me a hundred times. Would walk at the pretended I was
2:26:00
there. But then like Comcast came through and Prism and HBO and all of a
2:26:05
sudden I can watch Taxi Driver 14 times and The Elephant Man and Popey and
2:26:11
Apocalypse Now and Raging Bull like you know from from 12 to on that I would
2:26:18
never have had. It was like platoon for six months, gentle, you know what I mean? It's like there was one one
2:26:23
choice. So, yeah, it's interesting. Well, it's weird, too.
2:26:31
Like, now it's not even, oh, Apocalypse Now is on at 8:00 on Saturday. Pulled up clip that I was talking about,
2:26:36
which is instantly in the middle of a conversation, which is wonderful. Yeah. Yeah. It's great if it doesn't overwhelm you.
2:26:43
Yeah. If you use it and it doesn't use you. Yeah. But the problem is I feel like that with m I feel like that
2:26:49
with so many things. Don't you? It's like Yeah. Yeah. That's why I love books still. I still love books. It's like
2:26:54
a physical copy. Yeah, I do. I love books. Yeah. I don't necessarily read books
2:26:59
very often. Most of my interaction with literature is just audio.
2:27:04
Yeah. Just because of a time thing, right? For me, my time is just it's too difficult for me to manage all
2:27:10
I have a hard time staying with audio books. I it it Yeah. to retaining it. I
2:27:17
start thinking about the rhythm of the voice and the my brain goes to other things like who's the person talking,
2:27:23
you know, where are they sitting? I don't know. Like it it changes. Well, that's probably why you're a great actor. Yeah, maybe.
2:27:28
I mean, it has to have something to do with it because you're in this. You're considering this as a human being.
2:27:34
You're absorbing their humanity, right, while they're where this is like words and like unlocks my imagination.
2:27:40
It's like I'm here and it's like I don't know what's going to come, right? The words are in your head. The voices are in your head. Yes.
2:27:46
Yeah. And you don't necessarily have to assign a a sound to them. Yeah. They take on and they change and
2:27:52
they morph and you don't know what's going to happen. Well, there's probably a real value to that just in terms of the enhancement of your
2:27:59
own intellect just to constantly be doing that and as you're reading this
2:28:05
being in engrossed and absorbed in this person's writing and then like being
2:28:11
taken on this journey. Yes. where you it's like stimulating all these parts
2:28:16
I was just on the track in Rome in the Olympics, you know what I mean? And the guy was just coming and taking, you
2:28:21
know, wearing two sweatshirts to like intimidate, you know, like it's amazing. Yeah. It's uh
2:28:28
but it it it the good the thing that's maybe changing is like it does ask a lot of the reader or the viewer to use to
2:28:34
come at it with their imagination. Yes. And then there's something about taking all that away and you're just
2:28:41
receiving that'll be in it's very new and then then yeah that's a huge change.
2:28:47
There's not so much communication going on. It's just receiving. But there's also the mastery of like that guy doing Lord of the Rings
2:28:55
and like the the taking in what he's doing, you know, then realize this one
2:29:00
[ __ ] person is doing all these different voices is nuts. It's crazy. Yeah. But it's you have more access now
2:29:08
to other people's creations than ever before. Like you can be absorbed in other people's work all the time now.
2:29:15
Yes. Instantaneously on your phone. I'm sitting here. I'm bored. Let me just get someone's creation and plug it into my
2:29:21
head. Or somebody's thoughts on something or research they've done. Yeah. That's what's amazing. Oh yeah.
2:29:27
That's what's And that's what I've learned on your show, too. just every, you know, that just that I didn't no one had access like to that or or it was
2:29:34
frowned upon or like well you're not smart if you talk about this, right? You know, it's like let everybody
2:29:39
decide, right? And the truth is we don't know [ __ ] anything. No. Well, there's a lot of gatekeepers
2:29:45
when it comes to what you should or should not be interested in. Yeah. Or should or should not be discussing. I
2:29:50
remember being in college and there was a student, African-American student who I really I was friends with and I
2:29:55
remember him saying like, "Man, this the one course he's like, "It's just not they're not telling the story." And I
2:30:01
remember and he went and he talked, this is a 1995 or four, wait, I graduated in
2:30:07
97 from college. Yeah. So like yeah, four or I think I was a sophomore and like he was just what he was talking
2:30:12
about was like other other ways of looking at history and like can't we
2:30:18
just look at other stuff and it's fascinating, you know, now it's like there's whole, you know, courses on it
2:30:24
or sections that you can read and learn and hear what people, you know, that's kind of amazing.
2:30:30
Yeah, it definitely is. I I think it's amazing as long as you could be you know
2:30:37
like you not strict but as long as you can be um you know what's the word you
2:30:43
know that that you're like okay I'm looking at it this is not um you know the Bible of what it is but let me just
2:30:50
hear this take uh you know that's only healthy I think 100%. You know,
2:30:56
the problem and the fear is like, oh no, you're going to get and then the cults and the group and the thing and all of a sudden there's a movement and you know,
2:31:02
but whenever that happens anyway, there's so much infighting and the thing get diluted anyway. Like it's there's no
2:31:08
it's never going to work, right? Well, that's the thing about the Bible itself is the Bible is a series of
2:31:16
stories that were an oral tradition for who knows how many years before they eventually wrote it down. And then they
2:31:22
translated it from dead languages and eventually to English. You know, like what is this? Like what what was the
2:31:28
original? What what what is the meaning of this? Like what? And you don't even have to go back that that far. It's like just how we take it,
2:31:35
you know, lab, you know, all all they are labels of what's words, language. You and I communicate using these system
2:31:41
of symbols, vocal symbols that we both think mean something. Yeah. But when I say protein bites, it's like
2:31:48
you're looking at that differently than I am. that. So it's so impossible anyway. We're just desperately trying to
2:31:54
communicate. Yes, that's all we're doing. Like desperately and have a story. Like what's our story?
2:32:00
What's our story? That's going to be the weirdest aspect of communication through technology is that we're going to get to a point where
2:32:05
we're communicating without words. That's going to get really weird. Telepathy,
2:32:10
that to me is scary because I don't trust my thoughts. Do you know what I mean? Like if I've learned anything as I've gotten older,
2:32:16
it's like, "Oh yeah, let that wash through me." I don't have to judge myself for that. That was crazy. Right. Whoa. Right.
2:32:22
No, no, no. It's okay. Let it wash through. Judge me by my actions. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I do believe that. Not by what's going on inside my head.
2:32:29
Yeah. Yeah. But and then managing the thoughts and deciding what to act on and what not
2:32:34
to. And imagine like trying to consciously control your thought. I mean all of a sudd.
2:32:42
Well, I think it's going to be a completely different way of interacting with each other. That's going to be as
2:32:47
as crazy as internet communication and what we're dealing with now. That's
2:32:53
going to be another level of crazy because we're essentially going to be telepathic
2:33:00
and that's inevitable. That's that's in the world. I mean, Elon said that to me. He goes, "You're going to be able to communicate with no words."
2:33:07
I was like, "Okay, what does that mean?" Yeah. What is that like? What language is it going to be
2:33:12
in? Is it going to be in a new language? It's very exciting. Yeah. It's Well, it's very weird.
2:33:17
Yeah, it is. It's both. We're going to be different. Yeah. I just hope I'm around to experience it. You will be. Yeah.
2:33:22
Yeah. It's going to happen fairly quickly. I think it's going to happen within the next couple decades that things are
2:33:28
going to be unrecognizable. Uh if less than that.
2:33:33
Yeah. I mean, that's just being like really charitable. Yeah. That a couple It's probably going to be five years.
2:33:39
Yeah. I mean, you've talked to enough people that are on the front lines of it. And there there is one sort of constant thing that it's sooner than you
2:33:46
think. I know. And everyone on the front line is [ __ ] terrified. All of them. I know.
2:33:51
All even the ones that are working towards it. I know. They're all like That's true. Like, I don't know if this is good.
2:33:57
Yeah, I know. Yeah. I know. Strange stuff.
2:34:02

2:34:08
it. It's like I'm here and then like the elephant man by the end of it I just see your eyes talking to me. It's like I
2:34:14
forgot the room and Jamie and the whole thing. It's I I understand the gift. I get it. Well, it's cuz we're locked in.
2:34:20
Yeah. But I get it. I see. I get it because I've you know I love watching you have guests on and then through the
2:34:26
time you just start to things just start to shed off or it gets more awkward some
2:34:33
or like the rhythm gets off and it's just so fascinating. And so I'm I was I'm so uh honored to be able to be in

2:34:53

2:34:59
